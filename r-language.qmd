# R programming language

In a wider programming world, R sometimes has a slightly unfortunate reputation
as a badly designed "calculator language". A computing environment which is
maybe good for working with data frames and creating figures, but that's about
it. While certainly very useful for data science, R is a full-blown programming
language which is actually quite powerful even from a purely computer science
perspective.

Although this entire workshop is very firmly standing in the field of data
science and computational population genetics, and we will certainly use R
as a statistical and visualization environment, neglecting the "normal" aspects
of R as a "proper" programming language like any other and, worse still,
not regarding our use of R as programming, can be quite detrimental.
Even when "just" doing data science and statistics, we still use programming
constructs, we need to be aware of data types, algorithmic thinking, etc.
Neglecting these things makes it easy to introduce bugs into our code, make
it hard to find those bugs, and make our programs less efficient even when
they do work.

This chapter will help you get familiar with some of the less obvious aspects
of the R language or programming in general, definitely how data science is
presented in undergratuate courses in life sciences.

Because here's a crucial idea you might not be aware of: even when you're
"just" writing data analysis scripts, even when you're "just" plotting results,
you're still writing programs. You're a programmer. Exercises in this chapter
are designed to make you comfortable with programming and algorithmic thinking.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

simulate_trajectory <- function(p_init, generations, Ne) {
  trajectory <- c(p_init)

  # for each generation...
  for (gen in seq_len(generations)) {
    # ... based on the allele frequency in the current generation...
    p_current <- trajectory[gen]
    # ... compute the frequency in the next generation...
    n_next <- rbinom(Ne, 1, p_current)
    p_next <- sum(n_next) / Ne
    # ... and save it in the trajectory vector
    trajectory[gen + 1] <- p_next
  }
  
  return(trajectory)
}

traj1 <- simulate_trajectory(p_init = 0.5, generations = 1000, Ne = 1000)
traj2 <- simulate_trajectory(p_init = 0.5, generations = 1000, Ne = 1000)
traj3 <- simulate_trajectory(p_init = 0.5, generations = 1000, Ne = 1000)
traj4 <- simulate_trajectory(p_init = 0.5, generations = 1000, Ne = 1000)
traj5 <- simulate_trajectory(p_init = 0.5, generations = 1000, Ne = 1000)

plot(traj1, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 1), xlab = "generations", ylab = "allele frequency")
lines(traj2)
lines(traj3)
lines(traj4)
lines(traj5)
```
