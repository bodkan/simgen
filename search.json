    "text": "Preface\nThis online book contains materials for a work-in-progress course on the fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference, with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research.\nIt is being developed as part of the collaboration between University of Tartu and University of Copenhagen (Twinning project ECHO: Expanding Concept and Methodology for Human Past Studies in the Eastern Baltic Region).\nThe git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course (which will be developed over the span of 2025-2026) are available on GitHub at https://github.com/bodkan/simgen. Ultimately, the book will provide resources which will become the basis of a 1-2 weeks long course on population genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations, with a particular focus on R packages slendr and demografr. While introducing the fundamentals of population genomics, it will also aim to frame the material with a strong focus on the most important tools for facilitating reproducible research (such as git and renv), as well as demonstrate the most useful applications of a selection of R packages from the tidyverse data science toolkit.\n\nThe work-in-progress rendering of the book is available at https://bodkan.github.io/simgen.\n\n\nCurrently planned outline\n\nR\n\nIntroduction to R\n\nBasic data types, vectors, list, data frames\nPlotting with built-in base R functions\n\nReproducible computing in R\n\nCreating self-contained R command-line scripts\nWhy is renv useful\n\nVersion of control with git and GitHub\nBasics of data science with tidyverse\n\ntibble, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2\n\n\nslendr\n\nIntroduction to the slendr R package\nBuilding traditional demographic models with slendr\nSimulating genomic data\n\nWhat is a tree sequence?\nVCF files, EIGENSTRAT fileformat\n\n\nFundamentals of population genetics with slendr\n\nComputing tree sequence summary statistics\ndiversity, divergence, AFS\n\\(f\\)-statistics, \\(f_4\\)-ratio statistics\n\\(F_{st}\\)\nPCA\nIdentity-by-descent (IBD)\nAncestry tracts / chromosome painting\nAdmixture dating\n\nNatural selection with slendr\n\nBasic natural selection theory\nSimulating a simple\n\nSimulation-based inference with demografr\n\nToy grid-based inference of \\(N_e\\) with AFS\nGrid-based inference with demografr (\\(f_4\\) and \\(f_4\\)-ratio)\nGrid-based admixture tract dating\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)\nInference of selection using simulations\n\nIntroducing the workhorses of applied population genetics\n\nMDS / PCA\nADMIXTOOLS - \\(f\\)-statistics, qpAdm\nADMIXTURE / STRUCTURE\nIBD\n\n\n\nAll content is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.",
