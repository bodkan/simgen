    "text": "Preface\nThis online book contains materials for a work-in-progress course on the fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference, with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research.\nIt is being developed as part of the collaboration between University of Tartu and University of Copenhagen (Twinning project ECHO: Expanding Concept and Methodology for Human Past Studies in the Eastern Baltic Region).\nThe git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course (which will be developed over the span of 2025-2026) are available on GitHub at https://github.com/bodkan/simgen. Ultimately, the book will provide resources which will become the basis of a 1-2 weeks long course on population genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations, with a particular focus on R packages slendr and demografr. While introducing the fundamentals of population genomics, it will also aim to frame the material with a strong focus on the most important tools for facilitating reproducible research (such as git and renv), as well as demonstrate the most useful applications of a selection of R packages from the tidyverse data science toolkit.\n\nThe work-in-progress rendering of the book is available at https://bodkan.github.io/simgen.\n\n\nCurrently planned outline\n\nR\n\nIntroduction to R\n\nBasic data types, vectors, list, data frames\nPlotting with built-in base R functions\n\nReproducible computing in R\n\nCreating self-contained R command-line scripts\nWhy is renv useful\n\nVersion of control with git and GitHub\nBasics of data science with tidyverse\n\ntibble, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2\n\n\nslendr\n\nIntroduction to the slendr R package\nBuilding traditional demographic models with slendr\nSimulating genomic data\n\nWhat is a tree sequence?\nVCF files, EIGENSTRAT fileformat\n\n\nFundamentals of population genetics with slendr\n\nComputing tree sequence summary statistics\ndiversity, divergence, AFS\n\\(f\\)-statistics, \\(f_4\\)-ratio statistics\n\\(F_{st}\\)\nPCA\nIdentity-by-descent (IBD)\nAncestry tracts / chromosome painting\nAdmixture dating\n\nNatural selection with slendr\n\nBasic natural selection theory\nSimulating a simple\n\nSimulation-based inference with demografr\n\nToy grid-based inference of \\(N_e\\) with AFS\nGrid-based inference with demografr (\\(f_4\\) and \\(f_4\\)-ratio)\nGrid-based admixture tract dating\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)\nInference of selection using simulations\n\nIntroducing the workhorses of applied population genetics\n\nMDS / PCA\nADMIXTOOLS - \\(f\\)-statistics, qpAdm\nADMIXTURE / STRUCTURE\nIBD\n\nSpatio-temporal demographic models\n\nSpatial R packages\nSimulations of spatio-temporal population genetic data\nVisualisation of IBD networks in space\n\n\n\nAll content is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.",

    "text": "1.3 Part 3: Simulating genomic data\nOnce you have a compiled slendr model stored in an R variable (from now on, model will always mean a variable containing a compiled slendr model object relevant for the given exercise, for simplicity), we can simulate data from it. By default, slendr models always produce a tree sequence.\n\n\nNote: Tree sequence provides an extremely efficient means to store and work with genomic data at a massive scale. However, you can always get simulated data even in traditional file formats, such as VCF, EIGENSTRAT, or a plain old table of ancestral/derived genotypes.\nIn this activity we will be only working with tree sequences, because it’s much easier and faster to get interesting statistics from it directly in R.\nThere are two simulation engines built into slendr implemented by functions msprime() and slim(). For traditional, non-spatial, neutral demographic models, the engine provided by the msprime() function is much more efficient, so we’ll be using that for the time being. However, from a popgen theoretical perspective, both simulation functions will give you the same results for any given compiled slendr model (up to some level of stochastic noise, of course).\n\n\nNote: Yes, this means you don’t have to write any msprime (or SLiM) code to simulate data from a slendr model!\nHere’s how you can use the function to simulate a tree sequence from the model you’ve just created using compile_model() in your script:\n\nts &lt;- msprime(\n  model,\n  sequence_length = &lt;length of sequence to simulate [as bp]&gt;,\n  recombination_rate = &lt;uniform recombination rate [per bp per generation]&gt;\n)\n\nYou will be seeing this kind of pattern over and over again in this exercise, so it’s a good idea to keep it in mind.\nHint: The msprime() function has also arguments debug and run which can be extremely useful for debugging.\nSimulate a tree sequence from your compiled model using the msprime() engine, storing it to a variable ts as shown right above. Use sequence_length = 1e6 (so 1 Mb of sequence) and recombination_rate = 1e-8 (crossover events per base pair per generation). Then experiment with setting debug = TRUE (this prints out msprime’s own debugging summary which you might already be familiar with from your previous activity?) and then run = FALSE (this prints out a raw command-line which can run a slendr simulation in the shell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# This simulates a tskit tree sequence from a slendr model. Note that you didn't have\n# to write any msprime or tskit Python code!\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = 1e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8)\n\n# Setting `debug = TRUE` instructs slendr's built-in msprime script to print\n# out msprime's own debugger information. This can be very useful for debugging,\n# in addition to the visualization of the model as shown above.\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = 1e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, debug = TRUE)\n## DemographyDebugger\n## ╠═════════════════════════════════════╗\n## ║ Epoch[0]: [0, 1.67e+03) generations ║\n## ╠═════════════════════════════════════╝\n## ╟    Populations (total=4 active=4)\n## ║    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │       │     start│       end│growth_rate  │ CHIMP │ AFR │ NEA │ EUR │\n## ║    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  CHIMP│    5000.0│    5000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    AFR│   15000.0│   15000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    NEA│    1000.0│    1000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    EUR│    3000.0│    3000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n## ╟    Events @ generation 1.67e+03\n## ║    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │  time│type            │parameters              │effect                                  │\n## ║    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  1666│Migration rate  │source=EUR, dest=NEA,   │Backwards-time migration rate from EUR  │\n## ║    │      │change          │rate=0.000179640718562  │to NEA → 0.00017964071856287425         │\n## ║    │      │                │87425                   │                                        │\n## ║    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n## ╠════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n## ║ Epoch[1]: [1.67e+03, 1.83e+03) generations ║\n## ╠════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n## ╟    Populations (total=4 active=4)\n## ║    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │       │     start│       end│growth_rate  │ CHIMP │ AFR │    NEA    │ EUR │\n## ║    ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  CHIMP│    5000.0│    5000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │     0     │  0  │\n## ║    │    AFR│   15000.0│   15000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │     0     │  0  │\n## ║    │    NEA│    1000.0│    1000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │     0     │  0  │\n## ║    │    EUR│    3000.0│    3000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │ 0.0001796 │  0  │\n## ║    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n## ╟    Events @ generation 1.83e+03\n## ║    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │  time│type            │parameters             │effect                                  │\n## ║    ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  1833│Migration rate  │source=EUR, dest=NEA,  │Backwards-time migration rate from EUR  │\n## ║    │      │change          │rate=0                 │to NEA → 0                              │\n## ║    │┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈│\n## ║    │  1833│Census          │                       │Insert census nodes to record the       │\n## ║    │      │                │                       │location of all lineages                │\n## ║    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n## ╠════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n## ║ Epoch[2]: [1.83e+03, 2.33e+03) generations ║\n## ╠════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n## ╟    Populations (total=4 active=4)\n## ║    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │       │     start│       end│growth_rate  │ CHIMP │ AFR │ NEA │ EUR │\n## ║    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  CHIMP│    5000.0│    5000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    AFR│   15000.0│   15000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    NEA│    1000.0│    1000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    │    EUR│    3000.0│    3000.0│ 0           │   0   │  0  │  0  │  0  │\n## ║    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n## ╟    Events @ generation 2.33e+03\n## ║    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n## ║    │  time│type        │parameters      │effect                                │\n## ║    ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n## ║    │  2333│Population  │derived=[EUR],  │Moves all lineages from the 'EUR'     │\n## ║    │      │Split       │ancestral=AFR   │derived population to the ancestral   │\n## ║    │      │            │                │'AFR' population.

You should get a summary of a tree-sequence object that you’re familiar with from your msprime and tskit activity earlier in the day.\n\n\nNote: This is a very important feature of slendr – when a simulation is concluded (doesn’t matter if it was a slim() or msprime() simulation), you will get a normal tskit object. In fact, the fact that slendr supports (so far, and likely always) only a “subset” of all of tskit’s functionality isn’t stopping you to write custom Python/tskit processing code of a tree sequence generated from a slendr model.

Let’s look at a couple of them now.\nUse the ts_table function to inspect the low-level table-based representation of a tree sequence. For instance, you can get the table of nodes with ts_table(ts, \"nodes\"), edges with ts_table(ts, \"edges\"), and do the same thing for “individuals”, “mutations”, and “sites”. Does your tree sequence contain any mutations? If not, why, and how can we even do any popgen with data without any mutations? As you’re doing this, take a look at at the following figure (this was made from a different tree sequence than you have, but that’s OK) to help you relate the information in the tables to a tree sequence which those tables (particularly tables of nodes and edges) implicitly encode.\nThis should convince you that the final product of a slendr simulation really is the same kind of tree-sequence object that you learned about in the previous activities today.

It’s very unlikely, unless we’re extremely lucky, that we’ll ever have a sequence of every single individual in a population that we study. To get a little closer to the scale of the genomic data that we usually work with on a day-to-day basis, we can restrict our simulation to only record a subset of individuals.\nWe can precisely define which individuals (from which populations, and at which times) should be recorded in a tree sequence using the slendr function schedule_sampling(). For instance, if we have a model with some slendr populations in variables eur and afr, we can schedule the recording of 5 individuals from each at times 10000 (years ago) and 0 (present-day) (using the “years before present” direction of time in our current model of Neanderthal introgression) with the following code:\n\npop_schedule &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = c(10000, 0), list(eur, 5), list(afr, 5))\n\nThis function simply returns a data frame. As such, we can create multiple of such schedules (of arbitrary complexity and granularity), and then bind them together into a single sampling schedule with a single line of code, like this:\n\n# Note that the `times =` argument of the `schedule_sampling()` function can be\n# a vector of times like here...\nancient_times &lt;- c(40000, 30000, 20000, 10000)\neur_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = ancient_times, list(eur, 1))\n\n# ... but also just a single number like here\nafr_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(afr, 1))\nnea_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, time = 60000, list(nea, 1))\n\n# But whatever the means you create the individual sampling schedules with,\n# you can always bind them all to a single table with the `rbind()` function\nschedule &lt;- rbind(eur_samples, afr_samples, nea_samples)\nschedule\n\nUsing the function schedule_sampling (and with the help of rbind as shown in the previous code chunk), program the sampling of the following sample sets at given times, saving it to variable called schedule:\n\n\n\ntime\npopulation\n# individuals\n\n\n\n\n70000\nnea\n1\n\n\n40000\nnea\n1\n\n\n0\nchimp\n1\n\n\n0\nafr\n5\n\n\n0\neur\n10\n\n\n\nAdditionally, schedule the sampling of a single eur individual at the following times:\n\nt &lt;- seq(40000, 2000, by = -2000)\n\n\n\nNote: You can provide a vector variable (such as t in this example) as the times = argument of schedule_sampling().\nIn total, you should schedule the recording of 38 individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Here we scheduled the sampling of two Neanderthals at 70kya and 40kya\nnea_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = c(70000, 40000), list(nea, 1))\nnea_samples # (this function produces a plain old data frame!)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n   time pop       n y_orig x_orig y     x    \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n1 40000 NEA       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n2 70000 NEA       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n\n# Here we schedule one Chimpanzee sample, 5 African samples, and 10 European samples\npresent_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(chimp, 1), list(afr, 5), list(eur, 10))\n\n# We also schedule the recording of one European sample between 50kya and 2kya,\n# every 2000 years\ntimes &lt;- seq(40000, 2000, by = -2000)\nemh_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times, list(eur, 1))\n\n# Because those functions produce nothing but a data frame, we can bind\n# individual sampling schedules together\nschedule &lt;- rbind(nea_samples, present_samples, emh_samples)\nschedule\n\n# A tibble: 25 × 7\n    time pop       n y_orig x_orig y     x    \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 40000 NEA       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 2 70000 NEA       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 3     0 CHIMP     1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 4     0 AFR       5 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 5     0 EUR      10 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 6  2000 EUR       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 7  4000 EUR       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 8  6000 EUR       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 9  8000 EUR       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n10 10000 EUR       1 NA     NA     NA    NA   \n# ℹ 15 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, verify the correctness of your overall sampling schedule by visualizing it together with your model like this:\n\n\nNote: As you’ve seen above, the visualization is often a bit wonky and convoluted with overlapping elements and it can be even worse with samples added, but try to experiment with arguments to plot_model described above to make the plot a bit more helpful for sanity checking.\n\nplot_model(model, samples = schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_model(model, sizes = FALSE, samples = schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_model(model, sizes = FALSE, log = TRUE, samples = schedule)",

You can do this by providing the combined sampling schedule as the samples = schedule argument of the function msprime you used above. Just replace the line(s) with your first msprime() from the previous part of this exercise with the new one, which uses the schedule for customized sampling.\nAlso, while you’re doing this, use the ts_mutate() function to overlay neutral mutations on the simulated tree sequence right after the msprime() call.

Specifically, we will learn how to compute popgen statistics on slendr-simulated tree sequences using slendr’s interface to the tskit Python module.\nFirst, create a new R script exercise2.R and paste in the following code. This is one of the possible solutions to the Exercise 1, and it’s easier if we all use it to be on the same page from now on, starting from the same model and the same simulated tree sequence:\nAs a sanity check, let’s use a couple of tidyverse table-munging tricks to make sure the tree sequence does contain a set of sample which matches our intended sampling schedule (particularly the time series of European individuals and the two Neanderthals):\nEverything looks good! Having made sure that the ts object contains the individuals we want, let’s move to the exercise.\nThe toy model of ancient human history plotted above makes a fairly clear prediction of what would be the nucleotide diversity expected in the simulated populations. Compute the nucleotide diversity in all populations using the slendr function ts_diversity() in your tree sequence ts. Do you get numbers that (relatively between all populations) match what would expect from the model given the \\(N_e\\) that you programmed for each?\nHint: Nearly every slendr statistic function interfacing with tskit accepts a ts tree-sequence object as its first argument, with further arguments being either a vector of individual names representing a group of samples to compute a statistic on, or a (named) list of such vectors (each element of that list for a group of samples) – these lists are intended to be equivalent to the sample_sets = argument of many tskit Python methods (which you’ve learned about in your activity on tskit), except that they allow symbolic names of individuals, rather then integer indices of nodes in a tree sequence.\nAlthough you can get all the above information by processing the table produced by the ts_samples() function, slendr provides a useful helper function ts_names() which only returns the names of individuals as a vector (or a named list of such vectors, one vector per population as shown below).\nWhen you call it directly, you get a plain vector of individual names:\nts_names(ts)\n\n [1] \"NEA_1\"   \"EUR_1\"   \"NEA_2\"   \"EUR_2\"   \"EUR_3\"   \"EUR_4\"   \"EUR_5\"  \n [8] \"EUR_6\"   \"EUR_7\"   \"EUR_8\"   \"EUR_9\"   \"EUR_10\"  \"EUR_11\"  \"EUR_12\" \n[15] \"EUR_13\"  \"EUR_14\"  \"EUR_15\"  \"EUR_16\"  \"EUR_17\"  \"EUR_18\"  \"EUR_19\" \n[22] \"EUR_20\"  \"AFR_1\"   \"AFR_2\"   \"AFR_3\"   \"AFR_4\"   \"AFR_5\"   \"CHIMP_1\"\n[29] \"EUR_21\"  \"EUR_22\"  \"EUR_23\"  \"EUR_24\"  \"EUR_25\"  \"EUR_26\"  \"EUR_27\" \n[36] \"EUR_28\"  \"EUR_29\"  \"EUR_30\"\nThis is not super helpful, unless we want to compute some statistic for everyone in the tree sequence, regardless of their population assignment. Perhaps a bit more useful is to call the function like this, because it will produce a result which can be immediately used as the sample_sets = argument mentioned in the Hint above:\nts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\n\n$AFR\n[1] \"AFR_1\" \"AFR_2\" \"AFR_3\" \"AFR_4\" \"AFR_5\"\n\n$CHIMP\n[1] \"CHIMP_1\"\n\n$EUR\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\"\n\n$NEA\n[1] \"NEA_1\" \"NEA_2\"\nAs you can see, this gave us a normal R list, with each element containing a vector of individual names in a population. Note that we can use standard R list indexing to get subsets of individuals:\nnames &lt;- ts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\n\nnames[\"NEA\"]\n\n$NEA\n[1] \"NEA_1\" \"NEA_2\"\n\nnames[c(\"EUR\", \"NEA\")]\n\n$EUR\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\"\n\n$NEA\n[1] \"NEA_1\" \"NEA_2\"\netc.\nMany of the following exercises will use these kinds of tricks to instruct various slendr / tskit functions to compute statistics on subsets of all individuals sub-sampled in this way.\nAfter you computed nucleotide diversity per-population, compute it for each individual separately using the same function ts_diversity() (which, in this setting, gives you effectively the heterozygosity for each individual). If you are familiar with plotting in R, visualize the individual-based heterozygosities across all populations.\nHint: You can do this by giving a vector of names as sample_sets = (so not an R list of vectors). You could also use the data frame produced by ts_samples(ts) to get the names, just adding the heterozygosities to that data frame as a new column.",

    "text": "2.3 Part 3: Detecting Neanderthal admixture in Europeans\nLet’s now pretend its about 2008, we’ve sequenced the first Neanderthal genome, and we are working on a project that will change human evolution research forever. We also have the genomes of a couple of people from Africa and Europe, which we want to use to answer the most burning question of all evolutionary anthropology: “Do some people living today carry Neanderthal ancestry?”\nEarlier you’ve learned about \\(f\\)-statistics of various kinds. You have also heard that an \\(f_4\\) statistic (or its equivalent \\(D\\) statistic) can be used as a test of “treeness”. Simply speaking, for some “quartet” of individuals or population samples, they can be used as a hypothesis test of whether the history of those samples is compatible with there not having been an introgression.\nCompute the \\(f_4\\) test of Neanderthal introgression in EUR individuals using the slendr function ts_f4(). When you’re running it, you will have to provide individuals to compute the statistic using a slightly different format. Take a look at the help page available as ?ts_f4 for more information. When you’re computing the \\(f_4\\), make sure to set mode = \"branch\" argument of the ts_f4() function (we will get to why a bit later).\n\n\nNote: By default, each slendr / tskit statistic function operates on mutations, and this will switch them to use branch length (as you might know, \\(f\\)-statistics are mathematically defined using branch lengths in trees and mode = \"branch\" does exactly that).\nHint: If you haven’t learned this in your \\(f\\)-statistics lecture, you want to compute (and compare) the values of these two statistics using the slendr function ts_f4():\n\n\\(f_4\\)(&lt;some African&gt;, &lt;another African&gt;; &lt;Neanderthal&gt;, &lt;Chimp&gt;)\n\\(f_4\\)(&lt;some African&gt;, &lt;a test European&gt;; &lt;Neanderthal&gt;, &lt;Chimp&gt;),\n\nhere &lt;individual&gt; can be the name of any individual recorded in your tree sequence, such as names you saw as name column in the table returned by ts_samples(ts) (i.e. \"NEA_1\" could be used as a “representative” &lt;Neanderthal&gt; in those equations, similarly for \"CHIMP_1\" as the fourth sample in the \\(f_4\\) quarted representing the outgroup).\nTo simplify things a lot, we can understand the above equations as comparing the counts of so-called BABA and ABBA allele patterns between the quarted of samples specified in the statistics:\n\\[\nf_4(AFR, X; NEA, CHIMP) = \\frac{\\#BABA - \\#ABBA}{\\#SNPs}\n\\]\nThe first \\(f_4\\) statistic above is not expected to give values “too different” from 0 (even in case of Neanderthal introgression into Europeans) because we don’t expect two African individuals to differ “significantly” in terms of how much alleles they share with a Neanderthal (because their ancestors never met Neanderthals!). The other should – if there was a Neanderthal introgression into Europeans some time in their history – be “significantly negative”.\nIs the second of those two statistics “much more negative” than the first, as expected assuming introgression from Neanderthals into Europeans?\nWhy am I putting “significantly” and “much more negative” in quotes in the previous sentence? What are we missing here for this being a true hypothesis test as you might be accustomed to from computing \\(f\\)-statistics using a tool such as ADMIXTOOLS?

    "text": "2.4 Part 4: Detecting Neanderthal admixture in Europeans v2.0\nThe fact that we don’t get something equivalent to a p-value in these kinds of simulations is generally not a problem, because we’re often interested in establishing a trend of a statistic under various conditions, and understanding when and how its expected value behaves in a certain way. If statistical noise is a problem, we work around this by computing a statistic on multiple simulation replicates or even increasing the sample sizes.\n\n\nNote: To see this in practice, you can check out a paper in which I used this approach quite successfully on a related problem.\nOn top of that, p-value of something like an \\(f\\)-statistic (whether it’s significantly different from zero) is also strongly affected by quality of the data, sequencing errors, coverage, etc. (which can certainly be examined using simulations!). However, these are aspects of modeling which are quite orthogonal to the problem of investigating the expectations and trends of statistics given some underlying evolutionary model, which is what we’re after in these exercises.\nThat said, even in perfect simulated data, what exactly does “significantly different from zero compared to some baseline expectation” mean can be blurred by noise with simple single-individual comparisons that we did above. Let’s increase the sample size a bit to see if a statistical pattern expected in \\(f_4\\) statistic from our Neanderthal introgression model becomes more apparent.\nCompute the first \\(f_4\\) statistic (the baseline expectation between a pair of Africans) and the second \\(f_4\\) statistic (comparing an African and a European), but this time on all recorded Africans and all recorded Europeans, respectively. Plot the distributions of those two sets of statistics. This should remove lots of the uncertainty and make a statistical trend stand out much more clearly.\nHint: Whenever you need to compute something for many things in sequence, looping is very useful. One way to do compute, say, an \\(f_4\\) statistic over many individuals is by using this kind of pattern using R’s looping function lapply():\n\n# Loop over vector of individual names (variable x) and apply a given ts_f4()\n# expression on each individual (note the ts_f4(..., X = x, ...) in the code)\nlist_f4 &lt;- lapply(\n  c(\"ind_1\", \"ind_2\", ...),\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n\n# The above gives us a list of data frames, so we need to bind them all into a\n# single table for easier interpretation and visualization\ndf_f4 &lt;- do.call(rbind, list_f4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# This gives us list of vectors of the names of all individuals in each\n# population...\nsample_sets &lt;- ts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\n# ... which we can then access like this\nsample_sets$AFR # all Africans\n\n[1] \"AFR_1\" \"AFR_2\" \"AFR_3\" \"AFR_4\" \"AFR_5\"\n\nsample_sets$EUR # all Europeans\n\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\"\n\n# Let's compute the f4 statistic for all Africans... \nf4_afr_list &lt;- lapply(\n  sample_sets$AFR,\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n# ... and Europeans\nf4_eur_list &lt;- lapply(\n  sample_sets$EUR,\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n\n# Bind each list of data frames into a single data frame\nf4_afr &lt;- do.call(rbind, f4_afr_list)\nf4_eur &lt;- do.call(rbind, f4_eur_list)\n\n# Let's add population columns to each of the two results for easier plotting\nf4_afr$pop &lt;- \"AFR\"\nf4_eur$pop &lt;- \"EUR\"\n\n# Bind both tables together\nf4_results &lt;- rbind(f4_afr, f4_eur)\n\n# Visualize the results\nf4_results %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(pop, f4, color = pop)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"f4(AFR, EUR; NEA, CHIMP)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the \\(f_4\\) statistic test of Neanderthal introgression in Europeans indeed does give a much more negative distribution of values compared to the baseline expectation which compares two Africans to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Bonus 1: mode = \"branch\" vs mode = \"site\"\nRepeat the previous part of the exercise by setting mode = \"site\" in the ts_f4() function calls (this is actually the default behavior of all slendr tree-sequence based tskit functions).

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Part 1: A self-contained slendr function of \\(N_e \\rightarrow \\textrm{AFS}\\)\nSo far we’ve learned how slendr provides an easy way to define demographic models in R and simulate (even very large!) tree sequences from them. This allows us to quickly verify our intuition about some popgen problem (things like “Hmmm, I wonder what would an \\(f_4\\) statistic look like if my model includes this particular gene-flow event?), in just a few lines of R. There have been instances in which we’ve been able to even answer questions like this directly in a meeting, pretty much on the spot! This makes slendr a very powerful “popgen calculator”.\nNow let’s take things one step further. Imagine you gathered some empirical data, like an allele frequency spectrum (AFS) from a population that you study. That data was, in the real world, produced by some (hidden) biological process (demographic history) that we want to learn about. For instance, the population we study had some \\(N_e\\), which we don’t know the value of (the only thing we have is the observed AFS) but we want to infer that value.\nSimulations can be a great tool to estimate the most likely value of such an unknown parameter. Briefly speaking, in this particular toy example, we can simulate a large number of AFS vectors (each resulting from a different assumed \\(N_e\\) value) and then pick just those \\(N_e\\) values (or just one \\(N_e\\) value) which produced a simulated AFS closest to the observed AFS.\nThis is exactly what you’ll be doing just now in Exercise 3.\nIn a new script exercise3.R write a custom R function called simulate_afs(), which will take Ne as its only parameter. Use this function to compute (and return) AFS vectors for a couple of Ne values of your choosing, but staying between Ne = 1000 and Ne = 30000 Plot those AFS vectors and observe how (and why?) do they differ based on Ne parameter you used in each respective simulation.\nHint: The function should create a one-population forward-time model (our population starting at time = 1, with the model simulation_length = 100000 and generation_time = 1 in compile_model()), simulate 10Mb tree sequence using msprime() (recombination rate 1e-8) and then overlay neutral mutations on it at mutation_rate = 1e-8), compute AFS for 10 samples and return the AFS vector as result of this custom function.\nHint: If you’ve never programmed before, the concept of a “custom function” might be very alien to you. Again, if you need help, feel free to start building your exercise3.R solution based on this “template” (just fill in missing relevant bits of slendr code that you should be already familiar with):\nlibrary(slendr)\ninit_env()\n\nsimulate_afs &lt;- function(Ne) {\n  # In here you should write code which will:\n  #   1. create one population with a given Ne (provided as a function argument)\n  #   2. compile a model using `simulation_length =` and `generation_time =`\n  #   3. simulate a tree sequence\n  #   4. select names of 10 samples (doesn't matter which, \"pop_1\", \"po2_\", ...)\n  #   5. compute AFS vector from those 10 individuals using `ts_afs()`\n  \n  # `result` is a variable with your 10-sample AFS vector (we remove the\n  # first element because it's not meaningful for our example)\n  return(result[-1]) \n}\n\nafs_1 &lt;- simulate_afs(Ne = 1000) # simulate AFS from a Ne = 1000 model...\nplot(afs_1, type =\"o\")           # ... and plot it\nHint: If the above still doesn’t make any sense to you, feel free to copy-paste the function from the solution below into your script and work with that function instead!\nWhen used in R, your custom function should work like this (the simulation is stochastic, so your numbers will be different, of course):\nThe interface to all required Python modules has been activated.\n# This gives us a vector of singletons, doubletons, etc., etc., all the way\n# to the number of fixed mutations in our sample of 10 individuals\nsimulate_afs(Ne = 1000)\n\n [1] 359 150 145  74  80  56  39  55  40  54  45  52  30  31  12  25  17  20  33\n[20]  27",

What you just did is really very similar to how simulation-based inference is done in practice (even with methods such as ABC). Hopefully you can also see how easy does slendr make it.\nThis kind of approach can be used to infer all sorts of demographic parameters, even using other summary statistics that you’ve also learned to compute… including selection parameters, which we delve into in the next exercise.",

    "text": "4.0.1 Part 1: Simulating a tree sequence and computing Tajima’s D\nThe primary motivation for designing slendr was to make demographic modelling in R as trivially easy and fast as possible, focusing exclusively on neutral models. However, as slendr became popular, people have been asking for the possibility of simulating natural selection. After all, a large part of slendr’s functionality deals with population genetic models across geographical landscapes, which requires SLiM. So why not support selection simulations using slendr as well?\nIn December 2024 I caved in and added support for modifying slendr demographic models with bits of SLiM code, which allows simulating pretty much any arbitrary selection scenario you might be interested in.\nThis exercise is a quick demonstration of how this works and how you might simulate selection using slendr. We will do this using another toy model of ancient human history, which we will first use as a basis for simulating the frequency trajectory of an allele under positive selection, and then implementing a toy selection scan using Tajima’s D.\nTo speed things up, create a new exercise4.R script and copy the following code as a starting point for this exercise:\nNext, visualize the demographic model. If you did a bit of work in human population genetics, you might recognize it as a very simplified model of demographic history of Europe over the past 50 thousand years or so. As you can see, we are recording 50 individuals from four populations – for Europeans we sample 50 individuals at “present-day”, for the remaining populations we’re recording 50 individuals just before their disappearance. Also note that there’s quite a bit of gene-flow! This was an important thing we’ve learned about human history in the past 10 years or so – everyone is mixed with pretty much everyone, there isn’t (and never was) anything as a “pure population”.\nAlthough the point of this exercise is to simulate selection, let’s first simulate a normal neutral model using slendr’s msprime() engine as a sanity check. Simulate 10 Mb of sequence with a recombination rate 1e-8 and a sampling schedule defined above. Let’s not worry about adding any mutations, just to change things up a little bit. We’ll be working with branch-based statistics here (which means adding mode = \"branch\" whenever we will be computing a statistic, such as Tajima’s D).\nInspect the table of all individuals recorded in our tree sequence using the function ts_samples(), making sure we have all the individuals scheduled for tree-sequence recording. (Again, there’s no such a thing as too many sanity checks when doing research!)\nAs you’ve already learned in an earlier exercise, tskit functions in slendr generally operate on vectors (or lists) of individual names, like those produced by ts_names() above. Get a vector of names of individuals in every population recorded in the tree sequence, then use this to compute Tajima’s D using the slendr function ts_tajima(). (Use the same approach as you have with ts_diversity() or ts_divergence() above, using the list of names of individuals as the sample_sets = argument for ts_tajima()). Do you see any striking differences in the Tajima’s D values across populations? Check this for some general guidance.",

    "text": "4.1 Part 2: Computing Tajima’s D in windows\nLet’s take this one step forward. Even if there is a locus under positive selection somewhere along our chromosome, it might be quite unlikely that we would find a Tajima’s D value significant enough for the entire chromosome (which is basically what we did in Part 1 now). Fortunately, thanks to the flexibility of the tskit module, the slendr function ts_tajima() has an argument windows =, which allows us to specify the coordinates of windows into which a sequence should be broken into, with Tajima’s D computed separately for each window. Perhaps this will allow us to see the impact of positive selection after we get to adding selection to our model. So let’s first built some code towards that.\nDefine a variable windows which will contain a vector of coordinates of 100 windows, starting at position 0, and ending at position 10e6 (i.e., the end of our chromosome).

    "text": "4.2 Part 3: Adding positive selection to the base demographic model\nAlthough primarily designed for neutral demographic models, slendr allows optional simulation of natural selection by providing a “SLiM extension code snippet” with customization SLiM code as an optional argument extension = of compile_model() (a function you’re closely familiar with at this point).\nUnfortunately we don’t have any space to explain SLiM here (and I have no idea, at the time of writing, whether or not you will have worked with SLiM earlier in this workshop). Suffice to say that SLiM is another very popular population genetic simulator software which allows simulation of selection, and which requires you to write custom code in a different programming language called Eidos.\nTake a look at the file slim_extension.txt provided in your working directory (it’s also part of the GitHub repository here). If you worked with SLiM before, glance through the script casually and see if it makes any sense to you. If you have not worked with SLiM before, look for the strange {elements} in curly brackets in the first ten lines of the script. Those are the parameters of the selection model we will be customizing the standard neutral demographic model we started with in the next step.\nSpecifically, when you inspect the slim_extension.txt file, you can see that this “SLiM extension script” I provided for you has three parameters:\n\norigin_pop – in which population should a beneficial allele appear,\ns – what should be the selection coefficient of the beneficial allele, and\nonset_time – at which time should the allele appear in the origin_pop.\n\nHowever, at the start, the SLiM extension snippet doesn’t contain any concrete values of those parameters, but only their {origin_pop}, {s}, and {onset_time} placeholders.\nUse the slendr function substitute_values() to substitute concrete values for those parameters like this:\n\nextension &lt;- substitute_values(\n  template = here::here(\"slim_extension.txt\"),\n  origin_pop = \"EUR\",\n  s = 0.15,\n  onset_time = 12000\n)\nextension\n\n[1] \"/var/folders/70/b_q2zdh116b9pfg29p03sx600000gn/T//Rtmp3SV1rS/file3c3e22d9c555\"\n\n\nYou can see that substitute_values() returned a path to a file. Take a look at that file in your terminal – you should see each of the three {placeholder} parameters replaced with a concrete given value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the first 15 lines of the extension file before and after calling substitute_values(). We’ll do this in R for simplicity, but you can use less in plain unix terminal.\nBefore – see the {{placeholder}} parameters in their original form:\n\n\n// Define model constants (to be substituted) all in one place\n// (each {{placeholder}} will be replaced by a value passed from R).\n// Note that string constant template patterns are surrounded by \"quotes\"!\ninitialize() {\n    defineConstant(\"s\", {{s}});\n    defineConstant(\"onset_time\", {{onset_time}});\n    defineConstant(\"origin_pop\", \"{{origin_pop}}\");\n\n    // compose a trajectory file based on given parameters\n    defineConstant(\"traj_file\", PATH + \"/\" + \"trajectory.tsv\");\n}\n\n\nAfter – see the {{placeholder}} parameters with concrete values!\n\n\n// Define model constants (to be substituted) all in one place\n// (each {{placeholder}} will be replaced by a value passed from R).\n// Note that string constant template patterns are surrounded by \"quotes\"!\ninitialize() {\n    defineConstant(\"s\", 0.15);\n    defineConstant(\"onset_time\", 12000);\n    defineConstant(\"origin_pop\", \"EUR\");\n\n    // compose a trajectory file based on given parameters\n    defineConstant(\"traj_file\", PATH + \"/\" + \"trajectory.tsv\");\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s all the extra work we need to turn our purely neutral demographic slendr model into a model which includes natural selection! (In this case, only a simple selection acting on a single locus, as you’ll see later, but this can be generalized to any imaginable selection scenario.)\nHow do we use the SLiM extension for our simulation? It’s very simple – we just have to provide the extension variable as an additional argument of good old compile_model(). This will compile a new slendr model which will now include the new functionality for simulating natural selection:\nCompile a new model of the history of populations afr, ooa, ehg, etc., by following the instructions above, providing a new extension = argument to the compile_model() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- compile_model(\n  populations = list(afr, ooa, ehg, eur, ana, yam),\n  gene_flow = gf, generation_time = 30,\n  extension = extension   # &lt;======== this is missing in the neutral example!\n)",

The latter can still interpret the same demographic model we programmed in R, just like the msprime() engine can, but will run the model using SLiM (and thus leveraging the new SLiM extension code that we have customized using substitute_values() above). We simply do this by switching from this:\n\n\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, samples = schedule)\n\nto this:\n\nts &lt;- slim(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, samples = schedule)\n\nAs you can see, you don’t have to modify anything in your model code, just switching from msprime to slim in the line of code which produces the simulation result.\n\nThe customized model will not only produce a tree sequence, but will also generate a table of allele frequencies in each population (SLiM experts might have noticed the revelant SLiM code when they were inspecting slim_extension.txt). We need to be able to load both of these files after the simulation and thus need a path to a location we can find those files. We can do this by calling the slim() function as path &lt;- slim(..., path = TRUE) (so with the extra path = argument). This will return a path to where the slim() engine saved all files with our desired results.\n\nRun a simulation from the modified model of selection with the slim() engine as instructed in points number 1. and 2. above, then use the list.files(path) function in R to take a look in the directory.

    "text": "4.5 Part 6: Tajima’s D (genome-wide and window-based) from the selection model\nRecall that your simulation run saved results in the location stored in the path variable:\n\nlist.files(path)\n\n[1] \"slim.trees\"     \"trajectory.tsv\"\n\n\nFrom this path, we’ve already successfuly investigated the frequency trajectories.\nNow let’s compute Tajima’s D on the tree sequence simulated from our selection model. Hopefully we should see an interesting pattern in our selection scan? For instance, we don’t know yet where in the genome is the putative locus under selection!\nTo read a tree sequence simulated with slim() by our customized selection setup, we need to do a bit of work. To simplify things a bit, here’s the R code which makes it possible to do. Just copy it in your exercise4.R script as it is:\n\n# Let's use my own saved simulation results, so that we're all on the\n# same page going forward\npath &lt;- here::here(\"data/selection\")\n\nts &lt;-\n  file.path(path, \"slim.trees\") %&gt;%  # 1. compose full path to the slim.trees file\n  ts_read(model) %&gt;%                 # 2. read the tree sequence file into R\n  ts_recapitate(Ne = 5000, recombination_rate = 1e-8) # 3. perform recapitation\n\nVery briefly, because our tree sequence was generated by SLiM, it’s very likely that not all genealogies along the simulated genome will be fully coalesced (i.e., not all tree will have a single root). To explain why this is the case is out of the scope of this session, but read here if you’re interested in learning more. For the time being, it suffices to say that we can pass the (uncoalesced) tree sequence into the ts_recapitate() function, which then takes a SLiM tree sequence and simulates all necessary “ancestral history” that was missing on the uncoalesced trees, thus ensuring that the entire tree sequence is fully coalesced and can be correctly computed on.\nNow that you have a ts tree sequence object resulting from a new selection simulation run, repeat the analyses of genome-wide and window-based Tajima’s D from Part 1 and Part 2 of this exercise, again using the provided helper functions process_tajima() and plot_tajima(). Can you identify which locus has been the likely focal point of the positive selection? Which population shows evidence of selection? Which doesn’t and why (look again at the visualization of the demographic model above)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamples &lt;- ts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\nsamples\n\n$ANA\n [1] \"ANA_1\"  \"ANA_2\"  \"ANA_3\"  \"ANA_4\"  \"ANA_5\"  \"ANA_6\"  \"ANA_7\"  \"ANA_8\" \n [9] \"ANA_9\"  \"ANA_10\" \"ANA_11\" \"ANA_12\" \"ANA_13\" \"ANA_14\" \"ANA_15\" \"ANA_16\"\n[17] \"ANA_17\" \"ANA_18\" \"ANA_19\" \"ANA_20\" \"ANA_21\" \"ANA_22\" \"ANA_23\" \"ANA_24\"\n[25] \"ANA_25\" \"ANA_26\" \"ANA_27\" \"ANA_28\" \"ANA_29\" \"ANA_30\" \"ANA_31\" \"ANA_32\"\n[33] \"ANA_33\" \"ANA_34\" \"ANA_35\" \"ANA_36\" \"ANA_37\" \"ANA_38\" \"ANA_39\" \"ANA_40\"\n[41] \"ANA_41\" \"ANA_42\" \"ANA_43\" \"ANA_44\" \"ANA_45\" \"ANA_46\" \"ANA_47\" \"ANA_48\"\n[49] \"ANA_49\" \"ANA_50\"\n\n$EHG\n [1] \"EHG_1\"  \"EHG_2\"  \"EHG_3\"  \"EHG_4\"  \"EHG_5\"  \"EHG_6\"  \"EHG_7\"  \"EHG_8\" \n [9] \"EHG_9\"  \"EHG_10\" \"EHG_11\" \"EHG_12\" \"EHG_13\" \"EHG_14\" \"EHG_15\" \"EHG_16\"\n[17] \"EHG_17\" \"EHG_18\" \"EHG_19\" \"EHG_20\" \"EHG_21\" \"EHG_22\" \"EHG_23\" \"EHG_24\"\n[25] \"EHG_25\" \"EHG_26\" \"EHG_27\" \"EHG_28\" \"EHG_29\" \"EHG_30\" \"EHG_31\" \"EHG_32\"\n[33] \"EHG_33\" \"EHG_34\" \"EHG_35\" \"EHG_36\" \"EHG_37\" \"EHG_38\" \"EHG_39\" \"EHG_40\"\n[41] \"EHG_41\" \"EHG_42\" \"EHG_43\" \"EHG_44\" \"EHG_45\" \"EHG_46\" \"EHG_47\" \"EHG_48\"\n[49] \"EHG_49\" \"EHG_50\"\n\n$EUR\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\" \"EUR_31\" \"EUR_32\"\n[33] \"EUR_33\" \"EUR_34\" \"EUR_35\" \"EUR_36\" \"EUR_37\" \"EUR_38\" \"EUR_39\" \"EUR_40\"\n[41] \"EUR_41\" \"EUR_42\" \"EUR_43\" \"EUR_44\" \"EUR_45\" \"EUR_46\" \"EUR_47\" \"EUR_48\"\n[49] \"EUR_49\" \"EUR_50\"\n\n$YAM\n [1] \"YAM_1\"  \"YAM_2\"  \"YAM_3\"  \"YAM_4\"  \"YAM_5\"  \"YAM_6\"  \"YAM_7\"  \"YAM_8\" \n [9] \"YAM_9\"  \"YAM_10\" \"YAM_11\" \"YAM_12\" \"YAM_13\" \"YAM_14\" \"YAM_15\" \"YAM_16\"\n[17] \"YAM_17\" \"YAM_18\" \"YAM_19\" \"YAM_20\" \"YAM_21\" \"YAM_22\" \"YAM_23\" \"YAM_24\"\n[25] \"YAM_25\" \"YAM_26\" \"YAM_27\" \"YAM_28\" \"YAM_29\" \"YAM_30\" \"YAM_31\" \"YAM_32\"\n[33] \"YAM_33\" \"YAM_34\" \"YAM_35\" \"YAM_36\" \"YAM_37\" \"YAM_38\" \"YAM_39\" \"YAM_40\"\n[41] \"YAM_41\" \"YAM_42\" \"YAM_43\" \"YAM_44\" \"YAM_45\" \"YAM_46\" \"YAM_47\" \"YAM_48\"\n[49] \"YAM_49\" \"YAM_50\"\n\n# Overall Tajima's D across the 10Mb sequence still doesn't reveal any significant\n# deviations even in case of selection (again, not entirely unsurprising)\nts_tajima(ts, sample_sets = samples, mode = \"branch\")\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  set        D\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ANA    0.119\n2 EHG    0.118\n3 EUR   -0.306\n4 YAM   -0.263\n\n\n\n# So let's look at the window-based computation again...\nwindows &lt;- as.integer(seq(0, ts$sequence_length, length.out = 100))\n\n# compute genome-wide Tajima's D for each population in individual windows\ntajima_wins &lt;- ts_tajima(ts, sample_sets = samples, windows = windows, mode = \"branch\")\ntajima_df &lt;- process_tajima(tajima_wins)\n\nplot_tajima(tajima_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a clear dip in Tajima’s D around the midpoint of the DNA sequence, but only in Europeans.

    "text": "5.1 Part 1: Create a model\nNote: We’re unlikely to make it to this part, so this is extra bonus which can be ignored!\nIn earlier lectures you’ve learned about the Principal Component Analysis, a dimensional-reduction technique that’s a central piece of many (if not most) papers studying population history of many (hundreds) of individuals genotyped across many (millions) SNPs.\nAlthough incredibly popular, PCA has recently been a topic of controversy, with a highly combative paper criticizing the application of PCA in all of population genetics, almost to a point of claiming that none of the results can be published. As an example, take a look at Figure 5 in the paper, demonstrating that an Indian population can be arbitrarily placed in proximity to Europeans, East Asians, and Africans, simply by wiggling the sample sizes of all groups before they applying PCA on their genotype data.\nThis activity session is not a place to debate the merit of PCA (or any other popgen method for that matter). What we can do (as we’ve done in previous exercises) is to show how slendr can be used in a very easy way to evaluate patterns, expected behavior, and overall dynamics of many popgen metrics in a controlled settings – and in this way, verify our intuition and check the robustness of a method in question – using PCA as another example. We’ll be specifically looking at patterns which arise in PCA depending on the exact spatio-temporal sampling from a demographic model.\nStart a new script named exercise5.R with the following setup of another toy demographic model:\nlibrary(slendr)\ninit_env(quiet = TRUE)\n\nsource(here::here(\"utils.R\"))\n\npopA &lt;- population(\"popA\", time = 3000, N = 5000)\npopB &lt;- population(\"popB\", time = 1500, N = 5000, parent = popA)\npopC &lt;- population(\"popC\", time = 1500, N = 5000, parent = popA)\n\nmodel &lt;- compile_model(list(popA, popB, popC), generation_time = 1)\n\nschedule &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = seq(3000, 0, by = -200),\n                              list(popA, 10), list(popB, 10), list(popC, 10))\n\nplot_model(model, proportions = TRUE, samples = schedule)\nAs you can see, this model describes the demographic history of three populations: one ancestral population “popA” starting at 3000 generations ago, which splits into two populations “popB” and “popC” the same time at 1500 generations ago. We den instruct slendr to record 10 individuals from each of the three populations starting from 3000 generations ago all the way to 0 generations ago (i.e. the “present”), every 200 generations (remeber the seq() R function!).",

To avoid making this exercise even longer, I provided a helper function for you called plot_pca(). But this function isn’t doing anything magical – it uses the smartsnp R package to compute the principal components and visualize the results using ggplot2. This is something many of you could do given enough time but we want to focus on simulations and PCA, not pure R coding. If you’re interested, take a look at my implementation of plot_pca() here.\nHere’s how you can use this function (remeber that you need to put source(here::here(\"utils.R\")) into your script!):\n\nPlot PCA while coloring each individual by their population assignment:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"pop\")\n\n\nPlot PCA while coloring each individual by their time of sampling:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"time\")\n\n\nBy default, the function plots PC 1 vs PC 2, but you can customize things by providing an optional argument pc = like this:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"pop\", pc = c(2, 3))\n\nUse the provided plot_pca() function to run PCA based on genotypes for all recorded individuals that you just converted as EIGENSTRAT \"data/ABC_all\" from the ts tree sequence. Visualize PC 1 vs PC 2 by first ccolor each individual by their population label (color_by = \"pop\") then by the time of their sampling (color_by = \"time\").\nDoes the PCA of PC 1 vs PC 2 capture the relationship between all individuals across the populations and across time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_pca(\"data/ABC_all\", ts, color_by = \"pop\", pc = c(1, 2))\n\nPCA cache for the given EIGENSTRAT data was not found.

Which pair of PCs does the best job at recapitulating the demographic model?\n\n\nNote: We’re doing this purely for educational purposes and for fun, using an extremely idealistic demographic model which is perfectly known (by definition, because we simulated it) and perfect sampling scheme.

In order to do that, we need to be able to select only a defined subset of individuals from a given tree sequence. Which brings us to the last tree-sequence processing function in slendr callsed ts_simplify(). Implemented on top of the simplify() method in tskit, it has a very simple interface:\n\nts_small &lt;- ts_simplify(ts_big, simplify_to = c(&lt;subset of individuals as a vector&gt;))\n\nThis function call creates a new tree sequence, which is smaller and only contains a those individuals whose names were specified in simplify_to = (again, we’re talking about the “symbolic names” of individuals, such as “NEA_1”, “AFR_42”, etc., not integer numbers of tskit nodes).\nWhenever you want to create smaller subsets of a large tree sequence, it is often helpful to work with the table of all individuals in the original tree sequence, because it contains every individual’s name, pop assignment and the time in which it lived, so let’s save it for further use now:\n\nsamples &lt;- ts_samples(ts)\n\nnrow(samples)\n\n[1] 310\n\n\nFor instance, we can get only individuals from “popB” and “popC” sampled at the present using this code:\n\nsubset &lt;- filter(samples, pop %in% c(\"popB\", \"popC\"), time == 0)\n\nnrow(subset)\n\n[1] 20\n\n\nYou know that the table of samples contains the name of each individual, which you can access as subset$name. Use the ts_simplify() function to create a new tree sequence called ts_BC0 which contains only this subset of individuals. Check that it really does contain only the defined subset of individuals using ts_samples(ts_BC0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nts_BC0 &lt;- ts_simplify(ts, simplify_to = subset$name)\n\nts_samples(ts_BC0)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   name     time pop  \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 popB_71     0 popB \n 2 popB_72     0 popB \n 3 popB_73     0 popB \n 4 popB_74     0 popB \n 5 popB_75     0 popB \n 6 popB_76     0 popB \n 7 popB_77     0 popB \n 8 popB_78     0 popB \n 9 popB_79     0 popB \n10 popB_80     0 popB \n11 popC_71     0 popC \n12 popC_72     0 popC \n13 popC_73     0 popC \n14 popC_74     0 popC \n15 popC_75     0 popC \n16 popC_76     0 popC \n17 popC_77     0 popC \n18 popC_78     0 popC \n19 popC_79     0 popC \n20 popC_80     0 popC \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have a smaller tree sequence like this, you can convert it to an EIGENSTRAT file format using ts_eigenstrat() just like we did above.\n\n\n5.5.2 Part 2: PCA visualization on subsets of individuals\nTODO: Try to replicate some features of the results discovered for EUR/ASIAN/AFR/Indian populations.",
