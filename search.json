    "text": "In a wider programming world, R sometimes has a slightly unfortunate reputation as a badly designed “calculator language”. A computing environment which is (maybe!) good for working with data frames and creating figures, but that’s about it. However, while certainly very useful for data science, R is a full-blown programming language which is actually quite powerful even from a purely computer science perspective.\nBut still, this is a book about population genomics and data science in R. Why does this matter how much “real coding” we do in it?\nWell, although this entire workshop will primarily focus on R primarily as as a statistical and visualization environment, neglecting the aspects of R which make it a “proper” programming language (or even considering data science as “not real programming”) is a huge problem.\nFirst, even when “just” doing data science and statistics, we still use typical programming constructs, we need to be aware of underlying data types behind our data (mostly contents of tables), and we need to think algorithmically. Neglecting these things makes it easy to introduce bugs into our code, make it hard to find those bugs, and make our programs less efficient even when they do work.\nThis chapter will help you get familiar with some of the less obvious aspects of the R language or programming in general, certainly the parts which are often skipped in undergratuate courses in the life sciences in favor of just teaching plotting and running statistical tests. The good thing is, there isn’t that much you need to learn. And what you do learn will continue paying dividents for the rest of your research career!\nLet’s say it again, because people with non-computational backgrounds often feel inadequate when it comes to computational aspects of their work: Even when you’re “just” writing data analysis scripts, even when you’re “just” plotting results, you’re still writing programs. You’re a programmer. How exciting, right? Exercises in this chapter are designed to make you comfortable with programming and algorithmic thinking.",

    "text": "Getting help\nIn this first chapter, you will be exploring the basics of the R language. We will focus on topics which are normally taken for granted and never explained in basic data science courses, which generally immediately jump to data manipulation and plotting.\nI strongly believe that getting familiar with the fundamentals of R as a complete programming language from a “lower-level” perspective, although it might seem a little overwhelming at the beginning, will pay dividends over and over your scientific career.\nThe alternative is relying on magical black box thinking, which might work when everything works smoothly… except things rarely work smoothly in anything related to computing. Bugs appear, programs crash, incorrect results are produced—only by understanding the fundamentals can you troubleshoot problems.\nWe call this chapter a “bootcamp” on purpose – we only have a limited amount of time to go through all of these topics, and we have to rush things through a bit. After all, the primary reason for the existence of this workshop is to make you competent researchers in computational population genomics, so the emphasis will still be on practical applications and solving concrete data science issues.\nStill, when we get to data science work in the following chapters, you will see that many things which otherwise remain quite obscure and magical boil down to a set of very simple principles and components. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to these fundamentals.\nThis knowledge will make you much more confident in the results of your work, and much easier to debug issues and problems in your own projects, but also track down problems in other people’s code. The later happens much more often than you might think!\nBefore we even get started, there’s one thing you should remember: R (and R packages) have an absolutely stellar documentation and help system. What’s more, this documentation is standardized, has always the same format, and is accessible in the same way. The primary way of interacting with it from inside R (and RStudio) is the ? operator. For instance, to get help about the hist() function (histograms), you can type ?hist in the R console. This documentation has a consistent format and appears in the “Help” pane in your RStudio window.\nThere are a couple of things to look for:\nWhenever you’re lost or can’t remember some detail about some piece of R functionality, looking up ? documentation is always very helpful.\nAs a practice and to build a habit, whenever we introduce a new function like new_function() in this course, use ?new_function to open its documentation and skim through it. I do this many times a day to refresh my memory on how something works.",

Open RStudio, create a new R script (File -&gt; New file -&gt; R Script), save it somewhere on your computer as r-bootcamp.R (File -&gt; Save, doesn’t really matter where you save it).\nEvery time you encounter a new bit of code, looking like this:\n\n# here\n# is\n# some\n123\n# R\n\"code\"\n\nplease copy it into your script. You can then put your cursor at the beginning of that code chunk, and hit CTRL + Enter (on Windows/Linux) or CMD + Enter (on macOS) to execute it. Alternatively, you can also type it out to the R Console directly, and evaluate it by hitting Enter.\nIt will sound very annoying, but try to limit copy-pasting code only to very long commands. Typing things out by hand forces you to think about every line of code and that is very important! At least at the beginning.",

I.e., “assign the value 3.14 to a variable w1”\nWhen you type the variable names in your R console, you’ll get them printed back, of course:\n\nw1\n\n[1] 3.14\n\nx1\n\n[1] 42\n\ny1\n\n[1] \"hello\"\n\nz1\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nProgramming involves assigning values (or generally some objects in computer memory in general) to variables. In our code, variables change values, so we often need to check what is a type of some variable—are we working with a number, or some text, etc.? typeof() is one of the functions that are useful for this.\nWhat are the data “types” you get when you apply function typeof() on each of these variables, i.e. when you type and evaluate a command like typeof(w1)? Compare the result to the values you saved in those variables—what do you get?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nA “floating point” number is of a so-called type “double”:\n\ntypeof(w1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nInterestingly, “integer number” written like 42 is also represented as “double”, even though we don’t see a decimal point:\n\ntypeof(x1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nIn order to force a variable to be “really integer”, this is possible (note that strange L letter). But you can regard this as a quirk of R. It’s almost never a distinction that’s necessary. For 99.99% of my coding needs, a “number” is just a number, and “double” is OK even for integers:\n\nx1 &lt;- 42L\ntypeof(x1)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nGenerally speaking, “text” is represented by the data type “character” and is always defined by surrounding something in \" double quotes \":\n\ntypeof(y1)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nAnd the last important data type is “logical”, indicating whether something is TRUE or FALSE:\n\ntypeof(z1)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can test whether or not a specific variable is of a specific type using functions such as is.numeric(), is.integer(), is.character(), is.logical(). See what results you get when you apply these functions on these four variables w1, x1, y1, z1. Pay close attention to the difference (or lack thereof?) between applying is.numeric() and is.integer() on variables containing “values which look like numbers” (42, 3.14, etc.).\nNote: This might seem incredibly boring and useless but trust me. In your real data, such as in data frames (discussed below), you will encounter variables with thousands of rows, sometimes millions. Being able to make sure that the values you get in your data-frame columns are of the expected type is something you will be doing very very often, especially when troubleshooting! So this is a good habit to get into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nw1\n\n[1] 3.14\n\nis.numeric(w1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.integer(w1)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nx1\n\n[1] 42\n\nis.numeric(x1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.integer(x1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ny1\n\n[1] \"hello\"\n\nis.character(y1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nz1\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.logical(z1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.numeric(z1)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis.integer(z1)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize (and oversimplify a little bit) R allows variables to have several types of data, most importantly:\n\nintegers (such as 42)\nnumerics (such as 42.13)\ncharacters (such as \"text value\")\nlogicals (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\nWe will also encounter two types of “non-values”. We will not be discussing them in detail here, but they will be relevant later. For the time being, just remember that there are also:\n\nmissing values represented by NA—you will see this very often in data!\nundefined values represented by NULL\n\n\nWhat do you think is the practical difference between NULL and NA? In other words, when you encounter one or the other in the data, how would you interpret this?",

    "text": "Exercise 2: Vectors\nVectors are, roughly speaking, collections of values. We create a vector by calling the c() function (the “c” stands for “concatenate”, or “joining together”).\nCreate the following variables containing these vectors. Then inspect their data types using typeof() again, just like you did for “single-value variables” above. Again, copy-paste this into your script and evaluate using CTRL / CMD + Enter or paste it directly into your R Console and hit Enter:\n\nw2 &lt;- c(1.0, 2.72, 3.14)\nx2 &lt;- c(1, 13, 42)\ny2 &lt;- c(\"hello\", \"folks\", \"!\")\nz2 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntypeof(w2)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(x2)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(y2)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(z2)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the function is.vector() to test that a given object really is a vector.

A scalar (a single value) is simply a vector of length 1. Think of it this way: in a strange mathematically-focused way, even a single tree is a forest. 🙃\n\n\n\n\nDo elements of vectors need to be homogeneous (i.e., of the same data type)? Try creating a vector with values 1, \"42\", and \"hello\" using the c() function again. Can you do it? What happens when you try? Inspect the result in the R console (take a close look at how the result is presented in text and the quotes that you will see), or use the typeof() function again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmixed_vector &lt;- c(1, \"42\", \"hello\")\nmixed_vector\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"42\"    \"hello\"\n\n\n\ntypeof(mixed_vector)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nNotice that your values were all converted to text!\n\n\n\n\nIf vectors are not create with values of the same type, they are converted by a cascade of so-called “coercions”. A vector defined with a mixture of different values (i.e., the four “atomic types” we discussed in Exercise 1, doubles, integers, characters, and logicals) will be coreced to be only one of those types, given certain rules.\nDo a little detective work and try to figure out some of these coercion rules. Make a couple of vectors with mixed values of different types using the function c(), and observe what type of vector you get in return.\nHint: Try creating a vector which has integers and strings, integers and floats, integers and logicals, floats and logicals, floats and strings, and logicals and strings. Observe the format of the result that you get, and build your intuition by calling typeof() on each vector object to verify this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers mixed with characters are forced to become characters:\n\n\nv1 &lt;- c(1, \"42\", \"hello\")\nv1\n\n[1] \"1\"     \"42\"    \"hello\"\n\ntypeof(v1)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nIntegers and decimals are considered all doubles (this is what you saw above as R basically not distinguishing both that much, most of the time, for most practical reasons):\n\n\nv2 &lt;- c(1, 42.13, 123)\nv2\n\n[1]   1.00  42.13 123.00\n\ntypeof(v2)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\nA logical mixed with numbers is forced into a number! TRUE is 1 and FALSE is 0. This is used extremely often, so remember this rule!\n\n\nv3 &lt;- c(1, 42, TRUE, FALSE)\nv3\n\n[1]  1 42  1  0\n\ntypeof(v3)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\nv4 &lt;- c(1.12, 42.13, FALSE)\nv4\n\n[1]  1.12 42.13  0.00\n\ntypeof(v4)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\nNumber is again mixed with text, giving type character again:\n\n\nv5 &lt;- c(42.13, \"hello\")\nv5\n\n[1] \"42.13\" \"hello\"\n\ntypeof(v5)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nLogical is also forced into a character:\n\n\nv6 &lt;- c(TRUE, \"hello\")\nv6\n\n[1] \"TRUE\"  \"hello\"\n\ntypeof(v6)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of all these data type explorations, this Exercise is probably the most crucial for any kind of data science work. Why do you think I say this? Think about what can happen when someone does incorrect manual data entry in Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine what kinds of trouble can happen if you just load a table data from somewhere, if the values are not properly formatted. For instance, if a “numeric” column of your table has accidentally some characters (which can very easily happen when manually entering data in Excel, etc.). This will be much clearer when we get to data frames below.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough creating vectors manually c(\"using\", \"an\", \"approach\", \"like\", \"this\") is often helpful, particularly when testing bits of code and experimenting in the R console, it is impossible to create dozens or more values like this by hand.\nYou can create vector of consecutive values using several useful approaches. Try and experiment these options:\n\nCreate a sequence of values from i to j with a shortcut i:j. Create a vector of numbers 7:23 like this.\nDo the same using the function seq(). Read ?seq to find out what parameters you should specify (and how) to get the same result as the i:j shortcut above to get values 7-23.\nModify the arguments given to seq() so that you create a vector of numbers from 20 to 1.\nUse the by = argument of seq() to create a vector of only odd values starting from 1.\n\nseq() is one of the most useful functions, so keep it in mind!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 1\n7:23\n\n [1]  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n# 2\nseq(from = 7, to = 23)\n\n [1]  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n# 3\nseq(from = 20, to = 1)\n\n [1] 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n# 4\nseq(1, 20, by = 2)\n\n [1]  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19\n\n\nThis might look boring, but these functions are super useful to generate indices for data, adding indices as columns to tabular data, etc.**\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful built-in helper function (especially when we get to the iteration Exercise below) is seq_along(). What does it give you when you run it on this vector, for instance?\n\nv &lt;- c(1, \"42\", \"hello\", 3.1416)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseq_along(v)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nThis function allows you to quickly iterate over elements of a vector (or a list) using indices into that vector (or a list).",

In fact, you can, in principle, create lists of lists of lists of… lists!\nTry creating a list() which, in addition to a couple of normal values (numbers, strings, doesn’t matter) also contains one or two other lists (we call these lists “nested lists” for this reason, or also “recursive lists”). Don’t think about this too much, just create something arbitrary “nested lists” to get a bit of practice. Save this in a variable called weird_list and type it back in your R console, just to see how R presents such data back to you. In the next Exercise, we will learn how to explore this type of data better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an example of such “nested list”:\n\nweird_list &lt;- list(\n  1,\n  \"two\",\n  list(\n    \"three\",\n    4,\n    list(5, \"six\", 7)\n  )\n)\n\nWhen we type it out in the R console, we see that R tries to lay out the structure of this data with numerical indices (we’ll talk about indices below!) indicating the “depth” of each nested pieces of data (either a plain number or character, or another list!)\n\nweird_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"two\"\n\n[[3]]\n[[3]][[1]]\n[1] \"three\"\n\n[[3]][[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]][[3]]\n[[3]][[3]][[1]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[3]][[3]][[2]]\n[1] \"six\"\n\n[[3]][[3]][[3]]\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are confused (or even annoyed) why we are even doing this, in the later discussion of data frames and spatial data structures, it will become much clearer why putting lists into other lists allows a whole another level of data science work. Please bear with me for now! This is just laying the groundwork for some very cool things later down the line… and, additionally, it’s intended to bend your mind a little bit and get comfortable with how complex data can be represented in computer memory.",

    "text": "Exercise 4: Logical/boolean expressions and conditionals\nThis exercise is probably the most important thing you can learn to do complex data science work on data frames or matrices. It’s not necessary to remember all of this, just keep in mind we did these exercise so that you can refer to this information on the following days!\nLet’s recap some basic Boolean algebra in logic. The following basic rules apply (take a look at the truth table for a bit of a high school refresher) for the “and”, “or”, and “negation” operations:\n\nThe AND operator (represented by & in R, or often ∧ in math):\n\nBoth conditions must be TRUE for the expression to be TRUE.\n\nTRUE & TRUE == TRUE\nTRUE & FALSE == FALSE\nFALSE & TRUE == FALSE\nFALSE & FALSE == FALSE\n\n\nThe OR operator (represented by | in R, or often ∨ in math):\n\nAt least one condition must be TRUE for the expression to be TRUE.\n\nTRUE | TRUE == TRUE\nTRUE | FALSE == TRUE\nFALSE | TRUE == TRUE\nFALSE | FALSE == FALSE\n\n\nThe NOT operator (represented by ! in R, or often ¬ in math):\n\nThe negation operator turns a logical value to its opposite.\n\n!TRUE == FALSE\n!FALSE == TRUE\n\n\nComparison operators == (“equal to”), != (“not equal to”), &lt;or&gt;(\"lesser / greater than\"), and&lt;=or&gt;=` (“lesser / greater or equal than”):\n\nComparing two things with either of these results in TRUE or FALSE result.\nNote: There are other operations and more complex rules, but we will be using these three exclusively (plus, the more complex rules can be derived using these basic operations anyway).\n\nLet’s practice working with logical conditions on some toy problems.\nCreate two logical vectors with three elements each using the c() function (pick random TRUE and FALSE values for each of them), and store them in variables named A and B. What happens when you do A & B, A | B, and !A or !B? How do these logical operators work when you have multiple values? Can you deduce this from the results of these &, || and ! expressions on A and B vectors?\nFor extra challenge, try to figure out the results of A & B, A | B, and !A in your head before you run the code in your R console!\nHint: Remember that a “single value” in R is a vector like any other (specifically vector of length one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that we can compare not just single values (scalars) but also multiple values like vectors. When we do this, R performs the given operation for every pair of elements at once!\n\nA &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\nB &lt;- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\n\nA & B\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nA | B\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n!A\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n!B\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when you apply base R functions all() and any() on your A and B (or !A and !B) vectors?\nNote: Remember the existence of all() and any() because they are very useful in daily data science work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThese functions reduce a logical vector down to a single TRUE or FALSE value.\n\nA\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\nall(A)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nany(A)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the above all feels too technical and mathematical, you’re kind of right. That said, when you do data science, you will be using these logical expressions literally every single day. Why? Let’s return from abstract programming concepts back to reality for a second.\nThink about a table which has a column with some values, like sequencing coverage. Every time you filter for samples with, for instance, coverage &gt; 10, you’re performing exactly this kind of logical operation. You essentially ask, for each sample (each value in the column), which samples have coverage &gt; 10 (giving you TRUE) and which have less than 10 (giving you FALSE).\nFiltering data is about applying logical operations on vectors of TRUE and FALSE values (which boils down to “logical indexing” introduced below), even though those logical values rarely feature as data in the tables we generally work with. Keep this in mind!\n\nConsider the following vectors of sample coverages and origins (let’s imagine these are columns in a table you got from a bioinformatics lab) and copy them into your R script:\n\ncoverage &lt;- c(15.09, 48.85, 36.5, 1.12, 16.65, 0.79, 16.9, 46.09, 12.76, 11.51)\norigin &lt;- c(\"mod\", \"mod\", \"mod\", \"anc\", \"mod\", \"anc\", \"mod\", \"mod\", \"mod\", \"mod\")\n\nThen create a variable is_high which will contain a TRUE / FALSE vector indicating whether a given coverage value is higher than 5. Then create a variable is_modern which will contain another logical vector indicating whether a given sample is \"mod\" (i.e., “modern”).\nHint: Remember that evaluating coverage &gt; 5 gives you a logical vector and that you can store that vector in a variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis_high &lt;- coverage &gt; 5\nis_high\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\nis_modern &lt;- origin == \"modern\"\nis_modern\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the AND operator & to test if every high coverage sample (is_high) is also a modern sample (is_modern).\nHint: Apply the all() function to a logical expression you get by comparing both variables you just created with the == operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tests whether individual high coverage samples are also modern:\n\nis_high == is_modern\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAnd this tests whether all high coverage samples are also modern:\n\nall(is_high == is_modern)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nNote: You don’t always create dedicated throwaway temporary variables like this. You could easily do the same much more concisely (although maybe less readably). Both approaches are useful.\n\nall(coverage &gt; 5 & origin == \"modern\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was just a simple example of how you can use logical expressions to do filtering based on values of (potentially many) variables, all at once, in a so-called “vectorized” way (i.e., testing on many different values at once, getting a vector of TRUE / FALSE values as a result).\nYou’ll have much more opportunity to practice this in our sessions on tidyverse, but let’s continue with other fundamentals first, which will make your understanding of basic data manipulation principles even more solid.\n\nR has also equivalent operators && and ||. What do they do and how are they different from the & and | you already worked with? Pick some exercises from above and experiment with both versions of logical AND and OR operators.",

    "section": "Exercise 5: Indexing into vectors and lists",
    "text": "Exercise 5: Indexing into vectors and lists\nVectors and lists are sequential collections of values.\nTo extract a specific values(s) of a vector or a list (or to assign some value at its given position(s)), we use a so-called “indexing” operation. Generally speaking, we can do indexing in three ways:\n\nnumerical-based indexing (by specifying a set of integer numbers, each representing a position in the vector/list),\nlogical-based indexing (by specifying a vector of TRUE / FALSE values of the same length as the vector/list we’re indexing into, each representing whether or not – TRUE or FALSE – should a position be included in the indexing result)\nname-based indexing (by specifying names of elements to index)\n\nLet’s now practice those for vectors and lists separately. Later, when we introduce data frames, we will return to the topic of indexing again.\n\nVectors\n\n1. Numerical-based indexing\nTo extract an i-th element of a vector xyz, we can use the [] operator like this: xyz[i]. For instance, we can take the 13-th element of this vector as xyz[13].\nFamiliarize yourselves with the [] operator by taking out a specific value from this vector, let’s say its 5th element.\n\nv &lt;- c(\"hi\", \"folks\", \"what's\", \"up\", \"folks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv[5]\n\n[1] \"folks\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many operations in R, the [] operator is “vectorized”, meaning that it can actually accept multiple values given as a vector themselves (i.e, something like v[c(1, 3, 4)] will extract the first, third, and fourth element of the vector v.\nExtract the first and fifth element of the vector v. What happens if you try to extract a tenth element from v?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv[c(1, 5)]\n\n[1] \"hi\"    \"folks\"\n\n\nAccessing a non-existent element gives us a “not available” or “missing” value.\n\nv[10]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Logical-based indexing\nRather than giving the [] operator a specific set of integer numbers, we can provide a vector of TRUE / FALSE values which specify which element of the input vector do we want to “extract”. Note that this TRUE / FALSE indexing vector must have the same length as our original vector!\n\nCreate variable containing a vector of five TRUE or FALSE values (i.e., with something like index &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, ...), the exact combination of logical values doesn’t matter), and use that index variable in a v[index] indexing operation on the v vector you created above.\nNote: As always, don’t forget that you can experiment in your R Console, write bits of “throwaway” commands just to test things out. You don’t have to “know” how to do something immediately in your head—I never do, at least. I always experiment in the R Console to build up understanding of some problem on some small example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s our vector:\n\nv\n\n[1] \"hi\"     \"folks\"  \"what's\" \"up\"     \"folks\" \n\n\nThis index variable specifies the first, third, and fourth position of a vector:\n\nindex &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\nAnd we can index using this indexing vector variable like this, picking only elements of interest:\n\nv[index]\n\n[1] \"hi\"     \"what's\" \"up\"    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually we never want to create this “indexing vector” manually (imagine doing this for a vector of million values – impossible!). Instead, we create this indexing vector “programmatically”, based on a certain expression which produces this TRUE / FALSE indexing vector as a result (or multiple such expressions combined with &, | and ! operations), like this:\n\n# v is our vector of values\nv\n\n[1] \"hi\"     \"folks\"  \"what's\" \"up\"     \"folks\" \n\n# this is how we get the indexing vector to get only positions matching\n# some condition\nindex &lt;- v == \"up\"\n\nThis checks which values of v are equal to “three”, creating a logical TRUE / FALSE vector in the process, storing it in the variable index:\n\nindex\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nUse the same principle to extract the elements of the vector v matching the value “folks”.\nNote: As always, don’t forget that you can experiment in your R Console, write bits of “throwaway” commands just to test things out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex &lt;- v == \"folks\"\nindex\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nLet’s extract our matching values:\n\nv[index]\n\n[1] \"folks\" \"folks\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA nice trick is that summing a logical vector using sum() gives you the number of TRUE matches:\n\nindex\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\nsum(index)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThis is actually why we do this indexing operation on vectors in the first place, most of the time – when we want to count how many data points match a certain criterion.\n\nThere’s another very useful operator is %in%. It tests which elements of one vector are among the elements of another vector. This is another extremely useful operation which you will be doing all the time when doing data analysis. It’s good for you to get familiar with it.\nFor instance, if we take this vector again:\n\nv &lt;- c(\"hi\", \"folks\", \"what's\", \"up\", \"folks\", \"I\", \"hope\", \"you\",\n       \"aren't\", \"(too)\", \"bored\")\n\nWe can then ask, for instance, “which elements of v are among a set of given values?”:\n\nv %in% c(\"folks\", \"up\", \"bored\")\n\n [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWith our example vector v, it’s very easy to glance this with our eyes, of course. But when working with real world data, we often operate on tables with thousands or even millions of columns.\nTry the above example of using the %in% operator in your R Console to get familiar with.\n\nLet’s imagine we don’t need to test whether a given vector is a part of a set of pre-defined values, but we want to ask the opposite question: “are any of my values of interest in my data”? Let’s say your values of interest are values &lt;- c(\"hope\", \"(too)\", \"blah blah\") and your whole data is again v. How would you use the %in% operator to get a TRUE / FALSE vector for each of your values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the question is phrased differently, it’s still the same logical operation. So, if this is our set of values of interest:\n\nvalues &lt;- c(\"hope\", \"(too)\", \"blah blah\")\n\nOur test is then this:\n\nvalues %in% v\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nIndeed, the third element “blah blah” is not among the elements of v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists\nThis section will be a repetition on the previous exercises about vectors. Don’t forget — lists are just vectors, except that they can contain values of heterogeneous types (numbers, characters, anything). As a result, everything that applies to vectors above applies also here.\nBut practice makes perfect, so let’s go through a couple of examples anyway. Run this code to create the following list variable:\n\nl &lt;- list(\"hello\", \"folks\", \"!\", 123, \"wow a number follows again\", 42)\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"folks\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"!\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 123\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"wow a number follows again\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] 42\n\n\n\n1. Numerical-based indexing\nThe same applies to numerical-based indexing as what we’ve shown for vectors.\n\nExtract the second and fourth elements from l.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl[c(2, 4)]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"folks\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Logical-based indexing\nSimilarly, you can do the same with TRUE / FALSE indexing vectors for lists as what we did with normal vectors. Rather than go through the variation of the same exercises, let’s introduce another very useful pattern related to logical-based indexing and that’s removing invalid elements.\nConsider this list (run this code in your R Console again):\n\nxyz &lt;- list(\"hello\", \"folks\", \"!\", NA, \"wow another NAs are coming\", NA, NA, \"42\")\n\nxyz\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"folks\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"!\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] NA\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"wow another NAs are coming\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] NA\n\n[[7]]\n[1] NA\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"42\"\n\n\nNotice the NA values. One operation we have to do very often (particularly in data frames, whose columns are vectors as we will see below!) is to remove those invalid elements, using the function is.na().\nThis function returns a TRUE / FALSE vector which, as you now already know, can be used for logical-based indexing!\n\nis.na(xyz)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nAs you’ve seen in the section on logical expressions, a very useful trick in programming is negation (using the ! operator), which flips the TRUE / FALSE states. In other words, prefixing with ! returns a vector saying which elements of the input vector are not NA:\n\n!is.na(xyz)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\nUse is.na(xyz) and the negation operator ! to remove the NA elements of the list from the variable xyz!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxyz[!is.na(xyz)]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"folks\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"!\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"wow another NAs are coming\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"42\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[] vs [[ ]] operators\nLet’s move to a topic which can be quite puzzling for a lot of people. There’s another operator useful for lists, and that’s [[ ]] (not [ ]!). Extract the third element of the list l using l[4] and l[[4]]]. What’s the difference between the results? If you’re unsure, use the already familiar typeof() function on l[3] and l[[3]] to help you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nStrange, isn’t it? The [ ] operator seems to return a list, even though we expect the result 123?\n\nl[4]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 123\n\ntypeof(l[4])\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nOn the other hand, l[[4]] gives us just a number!\n\nl[[4]]\n\n[1] 123\n\ntypeof(l[[4]])\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nI simply cannot not link to this brilliant figure, which explains this result in a very fun way:\n\nThe left picture shows our list l, the middle picture shows l[4], the right picture shows l[[4]]. Spend some time experimenting with the behavior of [ ] and [[ ]] on our list l! This will come in handy many times in your R carreer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraversing nested lists\nRemember our nested list from earlier? Here’s it again:\n\nweird_list &lt;- list(\n  1,\n  \"two\",\n  list(\n    \"three\",\n    4,\n    list(\n      5, \"six\",\n      list(\"seven\", 8)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nWhat do you get when you run weird_list[[1]]? How about weird_list[[3]]? And how about weird_list[[3]][[2]]? Things are getting a little complicated (or interesting, depending on how nerdy you are :)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis takes out the first value of the list:\n\nweird_list[[1]]\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNote the [[ ]] operator. Here’s what we would get with the [ ] operator (basically, a “sublist”, i.e. a list again, just extracting the nested list):\n\nweird_list[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\ntypeof(weird_list[1])\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nThis extracts the 3rd value, which is itself a list!\n\nweird_list[[3]]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[[3]][[1]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[3]][[2]]\n[1] \"six\"\n\n[[3]][[3]]\n[[3]][[3]][[1]]\n[1] \"seven\"\n\n[[3]][[3]][[2]]\n[1] 8\n\n\nAnd because this is just any other list (just nested), we can also index into that list! Glancing at the result of weird_list[[3]] just above, we see that the 2nd value of that list is a number 4. Let’s verify that:\n\nweird_list[[3]][[2]]\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the sequence of this “chaining” of indexing operators we need to do to extract the value 8 from the weird_list?\nHint: Again, you can leverage the interactive nature of evaluating intermediate results in the R console, adding things to the expression (i.e., a chunk of code) in sequence, one step at a time. This is the R way of doing things! Start small, build up to something bigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs advised by the Hint, let’s take it step by step, interactively:\n\nWe know that the nested list sits at the 3rd position of the whole list:\n\n\nweird_list[[3]]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[[3]][[1]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[3]][[2]]\n[1] \"six\"\n\n[[3]][[3]]\n[[3]][[3]][[1]]\n[1] \"seven\"\n\n[[3]][[3]][[2]]\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nThe other nested list is at index number 3 again:\n\n\nweird_list[[3]][[3]]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"six\"\n\n[[3]]\n[[3]][[1]]\n[1] \"seven\"\n\n[[3]][[2]]\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nAnd the final list, the one carrying the number 8, is again in the 3rd position:\n\n\nweird_list[[3]][[3]][[3]]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"seven\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nFinally, we can extract the number 8 from the index at the second position:\n\n\nweird_list[[3]][[3]][[3]][[2]]\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhew! That last exercise was something, wasn’t it. Kind of annoying, if you ask me. The main purpose of these exercises is to force you (sorry!) to learn how to relate abstract concepts in your head to how data is represented in the computer. This will be very useful once we move to real-world data, which often features thousands or millions of rows of data points.\nLuckily, you will not have to do these kind of complex shenanigans in R very often (maybe even never). Still, nested lists are sometimes used in capturing more complex types of data than just lists of numbers or tables (for instance, nested lists capture tree-like structures). In any case, using names instead of just integers as indices makes the whole process much easier, as we will see below.\nIn data you encounter in practice, the most extreme case of data indexing you will have to do probably won’t be more complex than two nested indexing operators in a row (i.e., the equivalent of doing data[[2]][[3]]), so don’t stress about the above exercises too much.\nParticularly when we discuss some very convenient tidyverse operations later, having an idea about what a nested list even is will be very useful, so bear with me please!\n\n\nNamed indexing for vectors and lists\nHere’s a neat thing we can do with vectors and lists. They don’t have to contain just values themselves (which can be then extracted using integer or logical indices as we’ve done above), but those values can be assigned names too.\nConsider this vector and list (create them in your R session console):\n\nv &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nv\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nl &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 5\n\n\nAs a recap, we can index into them in the usual manner like this:\n\n# extract the first, third, and fifth element\nv[c(1, 3, 5)]\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\nl[c(1, 3)]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 3\n\n\nBut we can also name the values like this (note that the names appear in the print out you get from R in the console):\n\nv &lt;- c(first = 1, second = 2, third = 3, fourth = 4, fifth = 5)\nv\n\n first second  third fourth  fifth \n     1      2      3      4      5 \n\nl &lt;- list(first = 1, second = 2, third = 3, fourth = 4, fifth = 5)\nl\n\n$first\n[1] 1\n\n$second\n[1] 2\n\n$third\n[1] 3\n\n$fourth\n[1] 4\n\n$fifth\n[1] 5\n\n\nWhen you have a named data structure like this, you can index into it using those names and not just integer numbers, which can be very convenient. Imagine having data described not by indices but actually readable names (such as names of people, or excavation sites!). Try this:\n\nl[[\"third\"]]\n\n[1] 3\n\nl[c(\"second\", \"fifth\")]\n\n$second\n[1] 2\n\n$fifth\n[1] 5\n\n\nNote: This is exactly what data frames are, under the hood (named lists!), as we’ll see in the next section.\nLet’s return (one last time, I promise!) to our nested list example, this time presenting it in a more convenient way, using names:\n\nweird_list &lt;- list(\n  1,\n  \"two\",\n  nested1 = list(\n    \"three\",\n    4,\n    nested2 = list(\n      5, \"six\",\n      nested3 = list(\"seven\", 8)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nWith a list like that, when we previously had to extract the element 8 like this:\n\nweird_list[[3]][[3]][[3]][[2]]\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nwe can now do this:\n\nweird_list[[\"nested1\"]][[\"nested2\"]][[\"nested3\"]][[2]]\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nMuch more readable!\n\n\nNegative indexing\nA final topic on indexing (I think you are quite convinced now how crucial role does indexing play in data science in R)—negative indices.\nConsider this vector again:\n\nv &lt;- c(\"hi\", \"folks\", \"what's\", \"up\", \"folks\")\n\nWhat happens when you index into v using the [] operator but give it a negative number between 1 and 5?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative indices remove elements!\n\nv[-1]\n\n[1] \"folks\"  \"what's\" \"up\"     \"folks\" \n\n\nWhen we exclude all indices 1:5, we remove everything, oops!\n\nv[-(1:5)]\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this context, a very useful function is length(), which gives the length of a given vector (or a list – remember, lists are vectors!). Use length() to remove the last element of v using the idea of negative indexing.\nHow would you remove both the first and last element of a vector or a list (assuming you don’t know the length beforehand, i.e., you can’t put a fixed number as the index of the last element)?\nHint: Remember that you can use a vector created using the c() function inside the [ ] indexing operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv[-length(v)]\n\n[1] \"hi\"     \"folks\"  \"what's\" \"up\"    \n\n\n\n# this gives us the index of the first and last element\nc(1, length(v))\n\n[1] 1 5\n\n# then we can prefix this with the minus sign to remove them\nv[-c(1, length(v))]\n\n[1] \"folks\"  \"what's\" \"up\"",

    "text": "Exercise 6: Data frames\nEvery scientists works with tables of data, in one way or another. R provides first class support for working with tables, which are formally called “data frames”. We will be spending most of our time of this workshop learning to manipulate, filter, modify, and plot data frames, usually using example data too big to look at all at once.\nTherefore, for simplicity, and just to get started and to explain the basic fundamentals, let’s begin with something trivially easy, like this little data frame here (evaluate this in your R Console):\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  v = c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\"),\n  w = c(1.0, 2.72, 3.14, 1000.1, 1e6),\n  x = c(1, 13, 42, NA, NA),\n  y = c(\"folks\", \"hello\", \"from\", \"data frame\", \"!\"),\n  z = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)\n)\n\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z\n1   one       1.00  1      folks  TRUE\n2   two       2.72 13      hello FALSE\n3 three       3.14 42       from FALSE\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame  TRUE\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          !  TRUE\n\n\nFirst, here’s the first killer bit of information: data frames are normal lists of vectors!\n\nis.list(df)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nHow is this even possible? And why is this even the case? Explaining this in full would be too much detail, even for a course which tries to go beyond “R only as a plotting tool” as I promised you in the introduction. Still, for now let’s say that R objects can store so called “attributes” (normally hidden), which — in the case of data frame objects — makes them behave as “something more than just a list”. These hidden attributes are called “classes”. A list with this class attribute called “data frame” then behaves like a data frame, i.e. a table.\n\nYou can poke into these internals but “unclassing” an object, which removes that hidden “class” attribute. Call unclass(df) in your R console and observe what result you get..\nNote: Honest admission on my part — you will never need this unclass() stuff in practice, ever. I’m really showing you to demonstrate what “data frame” actually is on a lower-level of R programming. If you’re confused, don’t worry. The fact that data frames are lists matters infinitely more than knowing exactly how is that accomplished inside R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what a normal data frame looks like to us:\n\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z\n1   one       1.00  1      folks  TRUE\n2   two       2.72 13      hello FALSE\n3 three       3.14 42       from FALSE\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame  TRUE\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          !  TRUE\n\n\nHere is how a data frame is represented under the hood, after we remove the class attribute:\n\nunclass(df)\n\n$v\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\" \"four\"  \"five\" \n\n$w\n[1]       1.00       2.72       3.14    1000.10 1000000.00\n\n$x\n[1]  1 13 42 NA NA\n\n$y\n[1] \"folks\"      \"hello\"      \"from\"       \"data frame\" \"!\"         \n\n$z\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nattr(,\"row.names\")\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nIt really is just a list!\n\n\n\n\nRemember how we talked about “named lists” in the previous section? Yes, data frames really are just normal named lists with extra bit of behavior added to them (namely the fact that these lists are printed in a nice, readable, tabular form).\n\nSelecting columns\nQuite often we need to extract values of an entire column of a data frame. In the Exercise about indexing, you have learned about the [] operator (for vectors and lists), and also about the $ and [[]] operator (for lists). Now that you’ve learned that data frames are (on a lower level) just lists, what does it mean for wanting to extract a column from a data frame?\n\nTry to use the three indexing options to extract the column named \"z\" from your data frame df. How do the results differ depending on the indexing method chosen? Is the indexing (and its result) different to indexing a plain list?\nHint: Create a variable with the list with the same vectors as are in the columns of the data frame df to answer the last question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can extract a given column with…\n\nthe $ operator (column name as a symbol), which gives us a vector:\n\n\ndf$z\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\nthe [ operator (column name as a string), which gives us a (single-column) data frame:\n\n\ndf[\"z\"]\n\n      z\n1  TRUE\n2 FALSE\n3 FALSE\n4  TRUE\n5  TRUE\n\n\n\nthe [[ operator (column name as a string), which gives us vector again:\n\n\ndf[[\"w\"]]\n\n[1]       1.00       2.72       3.14    1000.10 1000000.00\n\n\nLet’s create a list-version of this data frame:\n\ndf_list &lt;- as.list(df)\ndf_list\n\n$v\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\" \"four\"  \"five\" \n\n$w\n[1]       1.00       2.72       3.14    1000.10 1000000.00\n\n$x\n[1]  1 13 42 NA NA\n\n$y\n[1] \"folks\"      \"hello\"      \"from\"       \"data frame\" \"!\"         \n\n$z\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nThe indexing results match what we get for the data frame. After all, a data frame really is just list (with some very convenient behavior, such as presenting the data in a tabular form). The only exception is the result of df_list[\"v\"] which results a data frame but only returns a list when applied on a list:\n\ndf_list$v\n\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\" \"four\"  \"five\" \n\ndf_list[\"v\"]\n\n$v\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\" \"four\"  \"five\" \n\ndf_list[[\"v\"]]\n\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\" \"four\"  \"five\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse approach\nIn the chapter on tidyverse, we will learn much more powerful and easier tools to do these types of data-frame operations, particularly the select() function which selects specific columns of a table. That said, even when you use tidyverse exclusively, you will still encounter code in the wild which uses this base R way of doing things. Additionally, for certain trivial actions, doing “the base R thing” is just quicker to types. This is why knowing the basics of $, [ ], and [[ ]] will always be useful. I use them every day.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting rows (“filtering”)\nOf course, we often need to refer not just to specific columns of data frames (which we do with the $, [ ], and [[ ]] operators), but also to given rows. Let’s consider our data frame again:\n\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z\n1   one       1.00  1      folks  TRUE\n2   two       2.72 13      hello FALSE\n3 three       3.14 42       from FALSE\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame  TRUE\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          !  TRUE\n\n\nIn the section on indexing into vectors and lists above, we learned primarily about two means of indexing into vectors. Let’s revisit them in the context of data frames:\n\n1. Integer-based indexing\n\nWhat happens when you use the [1:3] index into the df data frame, just as you would do by extracting the first three elements of a vector?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat curiously, you get the first three columns, not rows!\n\ndf[1:3]\n\n      v          w  x\n1   one       1.00  1\n2   two       2.72 13\n3 three       3.14 42\n4  four    1000.10 NA\n5  five 1000000.00 NA\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen indexing into a data frame, you need to distinguish the dimension along which you’re indexing: either a row, or a column dimension. Just like in referring to a cell coordinate in Excel, for example.\nThe way you do this for data frames in R is to separate the dimensions into which you’re indexing with a comma in this way: [row-index,  column-name-or-index].\n\nExtract the first three elements (1:3) of the data frame df by df[1:3, ].\nNote: Notice the empty space after the comma , in the question!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract the first three rows of df:\n\ndf[1:3, ]\n\n      v    w  x     y     z\n1   one 1.00  1 folks  TRUE\n2   two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n3 three 3.14 42  from FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen select a subset of the df data frame to only show the row #1 and #4 for columns \"x\" and \"z\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract the rows number 1 and 4 for columns “x” and “z”:\n\ndf[c(1, 4), c(\"x\", \"z\")]\n\n   x    z\n1  1 TRUE\n4 NA TRUE\n\n\nOf course, the actual indexing dimensions can be (and often is) specified in variables. For instance, we often have code which firsts computes the indexes, and then we access them into the data frames. The equivalent of this here would be:\n\nrow_indices &lt;- 1:3\n\ndf[row_indices, ]\n\n      v    w  x     y     z\n1   one 1.00  1 folks  TRUE\n2   two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n3 three 3.14 42  from FALSE\n\n\nExtract the rows number 1 and 4 for columns “x” and “z”:\n\nrow_indices &lt;- c(1, 4)\ncol_indices &lt;- c(\"x\", \"z\")\n\ndf[row_indices, col_indices]\n\n   x    z\n1  1 TRUE\n4 NA TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Logical-based indexing\nSimilarly to indexing into vectors, you can also specify which rows should be extracted “at once”, using a single logical vector (you can also do this for columns but I honestly don’t remember the last time I had to do this).\n\nThe most frequent use for this is to select all rows of a data frame for which a given column (or multiple columns) carry a certain value.\nSelect only those rows of df for which the column “y” has a value “hello”:\nHint: You can get the required TRUE / FALSE indexing vector with df$y == \"hello\". Again, if you’re confused, first evaluate this expression in your R console, then try to use it to filter the rows of the data frame df to get your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first use a vectorized comparison to get a TRUE / FALSE vector indicating which values of the “v” column contain the string “hello”. Remember, that if you take a vector (of arbitrary length) and compare it to some value, you will get a TRUE / FALSE vector of the same length:\n\n# this is what the column (vector, really) contains\ndf$y\n\n[1] \"folks\"      \"hello\"      \"from\"       \"data frame\" \"!\"         \n\n\n\n# this is how we can find out, which element(s) of the vector match\ndf$y == \"hello\"\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n# let's save the result to a new variable\nrow_indices &lt;- df$y == \"hello\"\nrow_indices\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nNow we can use this vector as a row index into our data frame (don’t forget the comma ,, without which you’d be indexing into the column-dimension, not the row-dimension!).\n\ndf[row_indices, ]\n\n    v    w  x     y     z\n2 two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n\n\nOf course, you can also both filter (remember this word) for a subset of rows and also, at the same time, select (remember this word too) a subset of columns at the same time:\n\ndf[row_indices, c(\"v\", \"y\", \"z\")]\n\n    v     y     z\n2 two hello FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, instead of filtering rows where column y matches “hello”, filter for rows of the df data frame where w column is less than 1000.\nHint: Same idea as above — first get the TRUE / FALSE vector indicating which rows of the data frame (alternatively speaking, which elements of the column/vector) pass the filtering criterion, then use that vector as a row index into the data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can again store the filtered rows in a separate variable, and then use that variable to index into the data frame:\n\nrow_indices &lt;- df$w &lt; 1000\nrow_indices\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\ndf[row_indices, ]\n\n      v    w  x     y     z\n1   one 1.00  1 folks  TRUE\n2   two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n3 three 3.14 42  from FALSE\n\n\nOften, we want to be more consise and do everything in one go:\n\ndf[df$w &lt; 1000, ]\n\n      v    w  x     y     z\n1   one 1.00  1 folks  TRUE\n2   two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n3 three 3.14 42  from FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember how we used to filter out elements of a vector using the !is.na(...) operation? You can see that df contains some NA values in the x column. Use the fact that you can filter rows of a data frame using logical-based vectors (as demonstrated above) to filter out rows of df at which the x column contains NA values.\nHint: You can get indices of the rows of df we you want to retain with !is.na(df$x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us indices of the rows we want to keep:\n\n!is.na(df$x)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nThis is how we can filter out unwanted rows:\n\ndf[!is.na(df$x), ]\n\n      v    w  x     y     z\n1   one 1.00  1 folks  TRUE\n2   two 2.72 13 hello FALSE\n3 three 3.14 42  from FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating, modifying, and deleting columns\nThe $ and [ ] operators can be used to create, modify, and delete columns.\n\nCreating a column\nThe general pattern to create a new column is this:\n\ndf$NAME_OF_THE_NEW_COLUMN &lt;- VECTOR_OF_VALUES_TO_ASSIGN_AS_THE_NEW_COLUMN\n\nor this:\n\ndf[\"NAME_OF_THE_NEW_COLUMN\"] &lt;- VECTOR_OF_VALUES_TO_ASSIGN_AS_THE_NEW_COLUMN\n\n\nFor instance, the paste() function in R can be used to combine a pair of values into one. Try running paste(df$v, df$y) to see what the result of this operation is.\nCreate a new column of df called \"new_col\" and assign to it the result of paste(df$v, df$y). Try to guess what will be this column’s values before you write and evaluate the code for your answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[\"new_col\"] &lt;- paste(df$v, df$y)\n\n# new column appears!\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z         new_col\n1   one       1.00  1      folks  TRUE       one folks\n2   two       2.72 13      hello FALSE       two hello\n3 three       3.14 42       from FALSE      three from\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame  TRUE four data frame\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          !  TRUE          five !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying a column\nThe above pattern doesn’t only apply to creating new columns. You can also update and change values of existing columns using the same technique!\nOur data frame df has the following values in the column z:\n\ndf$z\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nInvert the logical values of this column using the ! negation operator. In other words, the values of the modified column should be the result of !df$z.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how we can invert the values of the logical vector:\n\n# original vector/column:\ndf$z\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# inverted values:\n!df$z\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nModifying an existing column is the same as creating a column of the same name:\n\ndf$z &lt;- !df$z\n\n# result after this modification\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z         new_col\n1   one       1.00  1      folks FALSE       one folks\n2   two       2.72 13      hello  TRUE       two hello\n3 three       3.14 42       from  TRUE      three from\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame FALSE four data frame\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          ! FALSE          five !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving a column\nWhen we want to remove a column from a data frame (for instance, we only used it to store some temporary result in a script), we actually do the same thing, except we assign to it the value NULL.\nRemove the column new_col using this technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore:\n\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z         new_col\n1   one       1.00  1      folks FALSE       one folks\n2   two       2.72 13      hello  TRUE       two hello\n3 three       3.14 42       from  TRUE      three from\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame FALSE four data frame\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          ! FALSE          five !\n\n\nAfter:\n\ndf$new_col &lt;- NULL\n\n# and the column is gone\ndf\n\n      v          w  x          y     z\n1   one       1.00  1      folks FALSE\n2   two       2.72 13      hello  TRUE\n3 three       3.14 42       from  TRUE\n4  four    1000.10 NA data frame FALSE\n5  five 1000000.00 NA          ! FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Improper” column names\nMost column names you will be using in your own script will (well, should!) follow the same rules as apply for variable names – they can’t start with a number, have to compose of alphanumeric characters, and can’t contain any other characters except for underscores (and occasionally dots). To quote from the venerable R language reference:\n\nIdentifiers consist of a sequence of letters, digits, the period (‘.’) and the underscore. They must not start with a digit or an underscore, or with a period followed by a digit.\n\nFor instance, these are examples of proper identifiers which can serve as variable names, column names and (later) function names:\n\nvariable1\na_longer_var_42\nanotherVariableName\n\nUnfortunately, when you encounter data in the wild, especially in tables you get from other people or download as supplementary information from the internet, they are rarely this perfect. Here’s a little example of such data frame (evaluate this code to have it in your R session as weird_df):\n\nweird_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  `v with spaces` = c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\"),\n  w = c(1.0, 2.72, 3.14, 1000.1, 1e6),\n  `y with % sign` = c(\"folks\", \"hello\", \"from\", \"data frame\", \"!\")\n)\nnames(weird_df) &lt;- c(\"v with spaces\", \"w\", \"y with % sign\")\n\n\nweird_df\n\n  v with spaces          w y with % sign\n1           one       1.00         folks\n2           two       2.72         hello\n3         three       3.14          from\n4          four    1000.10    data frame\n5          five 1000000.00             !\n\n\nIf you look closely, you see that some columns have spaces \" \" and also strange characters % which are not allowed. Which of the $, [ ] and [[ ]] operators can you use to extract columns named \"v with spaces\" and \"y with % sign\" columns as vectors?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ] and [[ ]] work just as before, because they accept a string by default anyway, so spaces and other characters are not a problem:\n\nweird_df[\"v with spaces\"]\n\n  v with spaces\n1           one\n2           two\n3         three\n4          four\n5          five\n\nweird_df[[\"y with % sign\"]]\n\n[1] \"folks\"      \"hello\"      \"from\"       \"data frame\" \"!\"         \n\n\nThe $ operator needs bit more work. When you encounter an “improper” column name in a data frame, you have to enclose the whole “symbol” or “identifier” in “back ticks” like this:\n\nweird_df$`y with % sign`\n\n[1] \"folks\"      \"hello\"      \"from\"       \"data frame\" \"!\"         \n\n\nThis is super useful when working with tabular data you get from someone else, especially if they prepared it in Excel. But you should never create data frames with these weird column names yourself. Always use names that would be appropriate as normal standard R identifiers on their own (just alphanumeric symbols or underscores).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse approach\nSimilarly to previous section on column selection, there’s a much more convenient and faster-to-type way of doing filtering, using the tidyverse function filter(). Still, as with the column selection, sometimes doing the quick and easy thing is just more convenient. The minimum on filtering rows of data frames introduced in this section will be enough for you, even in the long run!",

    "text": "Exercise 7: Inspecting column types\nLet’s go back to our example data frame. Create it in your R session as the variable df1 by running this code:\n\ndf1 &lt;- data.frame(\n  w = c(1.0, 2.72, 3.14),\n  x = c(1, 13, 42),\n  y = c(\"hello\", \"folks\", \"!\"),\n  z = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n)\n\ndf1\n\n     w  x     y     z\n1 1.00  1 hello  TRUE\n2 2.72 13 folks FALSE\n3 3.14 42     ! FALSE\n\n\n\nUse the function str() and by calling str(df1), inspect the types of columns in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nstr() gives you a nice overview of the data types in each column:\n\nstr(df1)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ w: num  1 2.72 3.14\n $ x: num  1 13 42\n $ y: chr  \"hello\" \"folks\" \"!\"\n $ z: logi  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes (usually when we read data from disk, like from another software), a data point sneaks in which makes a column apparently non numeric. Consider this new table called df2 (evaluate this in your R session too):\n\ndf2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  w = c(1.0, 2.72, 3.14),\n  x = c(1, \"13\", 42.13),\n  y = c(\"hello\", \"folks\", \"!\"),\n  z = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n)\n\ndf2\n\n     w     x     y     z\n1 1.00     1 hello  TRUE\n2 2.72    13 folks FALSE\n3 3.14 42.13     ! FALSE\n\n\nJust by looking at this, the table looks the same as df1 above. In particular, the columns w and x contain numbers. But is it really true? You know that an R vector can be only of one type, and that if this isn’t true, a coercion is applied to force heterogeneous types to be of one type. Take a look at the column x above. Use str() to verify where the problem is with the data frame df2 with regards to what our expectation is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some reason, the whole column x has a data type “character”. There’s one sneaky “number” encoded as “13” and because a vector can have values of only one type (and because data frame columns are vectors), the entire column x is forced to be a text data type “character”:\n\nstr(df2)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ w: num  1 2.72 3.14\n $ x: chr  \"1\" \"13\" \"42.13\"\n $ y: chr  \"hello\" \"folks\" \"!\"\n $ z: logi  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful way of fixing these kinds of data type mismatch problems are conversion functions, primarily as.numeric(), as.integer(), and as.character().\nWhich one of these conversion functions would you use to fix the issue with a (what we want to be a numeric) column x having incorrectly the data type “character”?\nHint: Remember that just like you can create a column with df[\"NEW_COLUMN\"] &lt;- VECTOR_OF_VALUES or df$NEW_COLUMN &lt;- VECTOR_OF_VALUES, you can also modify an existing column, like we did above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the types of our mis-specified data frame df2:\n\nstr(df2)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ w: num  1 2.72 3.14\n $ x: chr  \"1\" \"13\" \"42.13\"\n $ y: chr  \"hello\" \"folks\" \"!\"\n $ z: logi  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nWe can fix the improper data types of the column x like this:\n\ndf2$x &lt;- as.numeric(df2$x)\n\nNotice the data type of the column x after this modification:\n\nstr(df2)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ w: num  1 2.72 3.14\n $ x: num  1 13 42.1\n $ y: chr  \"hello\" \"folks\" \"!\"\n $ z: logi  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new column of df2 called abc which will contain a transformation of the TRUE / FALSE column z into integers 1 or 0.

    "section": "Exercise 8: Base R plotting",
    "text": "Exercise 8: Base R plotting\nAs a final short section, it’s worth pointing out some very basic base R plotting functions. We won’t be getting into detail because tidyverse provides a much more powerful and more convenient set of functionality for visualizing data implemented in the R package ggplot2 (a topic for the next day).\nStill, base R is often convenient for quick troubleshooting or quick plotting of data at least in the initial phases of data exploration.\nSo far we’ve worked with a really oversimplified data frame. For more interesting demonstration, R bundles with a realistic data frame of penguin data. Use a helper function head() to take at the first couple of rows:\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n  species    island bill_len bill_dep flipper_len body_mass    sex year\n1  Adelie Torgersen     39.1     18.7         181      3750   male 2007\n2  Adelie Torgersen     39.5     17.4         186      3800 female 2007\n3  Adelie Torgersen     40.3     18.0         195      3250 female 2007\n4  Adelie Torgersen       NA       NA          NA        NA   &lt;NA&gt; 2007\n5  Adelie Torgersen     36.7     19.3         193      3450 female 2007\n6  Adelie Torgersen     39.3     20.6         190      3650   male 2007\n\n\n\n\nBase R histograms\nOne of the most basic types of visualizations is a histogram. This is provided by a built-in function hist(), which simply accepts a numeric vector as its only parameter. You know you can get all values from a column of a data frame using the $ or [[ ]] indexing operators. Use the function hist() to plot a histogram of the body mass of the entire penguins data set (take a look at the overview of the table above to get the column name).\nHow can you adjust the number of bins of the histogram? Check out the ?hist help page to find the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(penguins$body_mass)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it is convenient to adjust the bin width:\n\nhist(penguins$body_mass, breaks = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset also contains the measure of flipper lengths. Is there a relationship between this measure and body mass? Use the function plot() which plots a scatter plot of two numeric vectors (both given as x and y parameters of the function — look at ?plot again if needed!) to visualize the relationship between those two variables / columns: penguins$flipper_len against penguins$body_mass. Is there an indication of a relationship between the two metrics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the plain scatter plot — there does seem to be a linear relationship indeed, which makes sense! The larger the penguin (body mass) the longer its flippers!\n\nplot(penguins$flipper_len, penguins$body_mass)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust for fun, we can also overlay a linear fit (first computed with the lm() function, then visualized as a red dashed line using another built-in function abline():\n\nplot(penguins$flipper_len, penguins$body_mass)\n\nlm_fit &lt;- lm(body_mass ~ flipper_len, data = penguins)\nabline(lm_fit, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see that we have data for three different species of penguins. We can therefore partition the visualization for each species individually (again, you can always find additional options and examples in help pages such as ?plot):\n\nplot(penguins$flipper_len, penguins$body_mass, col = penguins$species)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase R plotting is very convenient for quick and dirty data summaries, particularly immediately after reading unknown data. However, for anything more complex (and anything more pretty), ggplot2 is unbeatable. For this reason, there’s no point in digging into base R graphics any further.\nWe will be looking at ggplot2 visualization in the session on tidyverse but as a sneakpeak, you can take a look at the beautiful figures you’ll learn how to make later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the sneakpeak\n\n\n\n\n\nLook how comparatively little code we need to make beautiful informative figures (much prettier than those made with base R functions like we did just above) which immediately tell a clear story! Stay tuned for later! :)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\nggplot(penguins) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(flipper_len, fill = species), alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of flipper lengths across species\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

    "text": "Exercise 9: Working with directories and files\nWhen we move on to the reproducibility session and begin discussing the benefits of writing self-contained, single-purpose R scripts as components of reproducible pipelines, it will come in handy for our scripts to do more than just munge on tables and create plots. Sometimes our scripts will create files. And those files need directories to be put in.\nYes, we can always do this manually in a file explorer of some sorts, but that is not automated and, as a result, it’s not reprodubile.\n\nCreating a directory\nYou can create a directory using a function dir.create(). Try it by creating a directory somewhere on your file system, named “testing-directory”. Look up ?dir.create help page to see useful options.\n\nWhat happens when you call a dir.create(\"testing-directory\") twice? Do you get an error or a warning? Is that warning necessarily a problem, or is it more that it’s annoying? (Imagine having a script which does this repeatedly, perhaps because it can be run repeatedly in a loop). How would you silence this problem? Again, look up the help under ?dir.create.\n\n\nListing files\nOften you have many different tables stored across multiple files. You then need to read all those tables, but calling a function like read_tsv() (which reads a data frame from disk — we’ll use it a lot in later sections!) a hundred times, manually, is impossible.\nA useful trick is to get a listing of files in a particular directory, using the function list.files().\nUse list.files() to list all files in your ~/Documents directory. Again, look up help for ?list.files to see how you should run this function. Experiment in your R console! Do you get full paths to each file? Or just filenames? How would you get full paths?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives only filenames:\n\nlist.files(path = \"~/Documents\")\n\n[1] \"archive\"    \"games\"      \"Garageband\" \"latexCV\"    \"postdoc\"   \n[6] \"Renoise\"    \"slides\"     \"talks\"      \"WeAreKU\"   \n\n\nFor reading from a script from any location, full.names = TRUE is important:\n\nlist.files(path = \"~/Documents\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n[1] \"/Users/mp/Documents/archive\"    \"/Users/mp/Documents/games\"     \n[3] \"/Users/mp/Documents/Garageband\" \"/Users/mp/Documents/latexCV\"   \n[5] \"/Users/mp/Documents/postdoc\"    \"/Users/mp/Documents/Renoise\"   \n[7] \"/Users/mp/Documents/slides\"     \"/Users/mp/Documents/talks\"     \n[9] \"/Users/mp/Documents/WeAreKU\"   \n\n\n\n\n\nUsing list.files() is particularly helpful in conjunction with the concept of looping introduced in one of the “Bonus exercises” towards the end of this Bootcamp session.\n\n\nTesting the existence of a directory or a file\nIn other setting, we need our script to test whether a particular directory (or, more often, a file) already exists. This can be done with the functions dir.exists() or file.exists().\nPick an arbitrary file you got in your ~/Documents listing. Then try file.exists() on that file. Then add a random string to that path to your file and run file.exists() again.\nThese functions are also super useful for building more comprehensive pipelines! Imagine a situation in which an output file with your results already exists, and you don’t want to overwrite it (but you want to run your script as a whole anyway).",

    "text": "Bonus content\nHere are some more advanced materials. These are very useful to know (and actually critical for writing more complex programs), but are not completely necessary to be able to successfully go through the later sessions on tidyverse and ggplot2.\nFeel free to go through them for your own interest though! They are very useful. Just don’t be stressed if this seems too much (especially if you haven’t done a lot of R coding before).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Functions\nThe motivation for this Exercise could be summarized by an ancient motto of programming: Don’t repeat yourself (DRY): “[…] a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.”.\nLet’s demonstrate this idea in practice.\nLet’s say you have the following numeric vector (these could be base qualities, genotype qualities, \\(f\\)-statistics, sequencing coverage, anything):\n\nvec &lt;- c(0.32, 0.78, 0.68, 0.28, 1.96, 0.21, 0.07, 1.01, 0.06, 0.74,\n         0.37, 0.6, 0.08, 1.81, 0.65, 1.23, 1.28, 0.11, 1.74,  1.68)\n\nWith numeric vectors, we often need to compute some summary statistics (mean, median, quartile, minimum, maximum, etc.). What’s more, in a given project, we often have to do this computation multiple times in a number of places.\n\nHere is how we can compute those summary statistics individually:\n\nmin(vec)\n\n[1] 0.06\n\n# first quartile (a value which is higher than the bottom 25% of the data)\nquantile(vec, probs = 0.25)\n\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\nmedian(vec)\n\n[1] 0.665\n\nmean(vec)\n\n[1] 0.783\n\n# third quartile (a value which is higher than the bottom 75% of the data)\nquantile(vec, probs = 0.75)\n\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\nmax(vec)\n\n[1] 1.96\n\n\nNow, you can imagine that you have many more of such vectors (results for different sequenced samples, different computed population genetic metrics, etc.). Having to type out all of these commands for every single one of those vectors would very quickly get extremely tiresome. Worse still, when we would do this, we would certainly resort to copy-pasting, which is guaranteed to lead to errors.\n\nWrite a custom function called my_summary, which will accept a single input named values, and returns a list which binds all the six summary statistics together. Name the elements of that list as \"min\", \"quartile_1\", \"median\", \"mean\", \"quartile_3\", and \"max\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is how we could write the function:\n\nmy_summary &lt;- function(values) {\n  a &lt;- min(vec)\n  b &lt;- quantile(vec, probs = 0.25)\n  c &lt;- median(vec)\n  d &lt;- mean(vec)\n  e &lt;- quantile(vec, probs = 0.75)\n  f &lt;- max(vec)\n  \n  result &lt;- list(min = a, quartile_1 = b, median = c, mean = d, quartile_3 = e, max = f)\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n\nAlthough I would probably prefer to write it a bit more tersely like this:\n\nmy_summary &lt;- function(values) {\n  result &lt;- list(\n    min = min(vec),\n    quartile_1 = quantile(vec, probs = 0.25),\n    median = median(vec),\n    mean = mean(vec),\n    quartile_3 = quantile(vec, probs = 0.75),\n    max = max(vec)\n  )\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, we had to write the code anyway, we even had to do the extra work of wrapping it inside other code (the function body, name the one input argument values, which could be multiple arguments for more complex function). So, one could argue that we didn’t actually save any time. However, that code is now “encapsulated” in a fully self-contained form and can be called repeatably, without any copy-pasting.\nIn other words, if you now create these three vectors of numeric values:\n\nvec1 &lt;- runif(10)\nvec2 &lt;- runif(10)\nvec3 &lt;- runif(10)\n\nYou can now compute our summary statistics by calling our function my_summary() on these vectors, without any code repetition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_summary(vec1)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\nmy_summary(vec2)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\nmy_summary(vec3)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\n\nAnd, surprise! This is what the incredibly useful built-in function summary() provided with every R installation does!\n\nsummary(vec1)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

Write a custom function penguin_hist() which will accept two arguments: 1. the name of the column in the penguins data frame, and 2. the number of histogram breakpoints to use as the breaks = arguments in a hist(&lt;vector&gt;, breaks = ...) call.\nHint: Remember that you can extract a column of a data frame as a vector not just using a symbolic identifier with the $ operator but also as a string name with the [[]] operator.\nHint: A useful new argument of the hist() function is main =.

We can do this using the if expression which has the following form:\n\nif (&lt;condition resulting in TRUE or FALSE&gt;) {\n  ... code which should be executed if condition is TRUE...\n}\n\nAn extension of this is the if-else expression, taking the following form:\n\nif (&lt;condition resulting in TRUE or FALSE&gt;) {\n  ... code which should be executed if condition is TRUE...\n} else {\n  ... code which should be executed if condition is FALSE...\n}\n\n\nGo back to your new penguin_hist() function and add an if expression which will make sure that breaks is greater than 0. In other words, if breaks &lt; 1 (the condition you will be testing against), execute the command stop(\"Incorrect breaks argument given!\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is our new modified function:\n\npenguin_hist &lt;- function(df, column, breaks) {\n  if (breaks &lt; 1) {\n    stop(\"Incorrect breaks argument given!\", call. = FALSE) # call. = FALSE makes errors less verbose\n  }\n\n  title &lt;- paste(\"Histogram of the column\", column)\n  hist(df[[column]], breaks = breaks, main = title)\n}\n\nAnd here is how our new modification guards against incorrect use of our function:\n\npenguin_hist(df, \"bill_len\", breaks = -123)\n\nError: Incorrect breaks argument given!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was just a little sneak peak. As you get more comfortable with programming, if and if-else expressions like this will be very useful to make your code more robust. Whenever you’re coding, catching errors as soon as they happen is extremely important!\n\n\nExercise 11: Iteration and loops\nFunctions help us take pieces of code and generalize them to reduce the amount of code needed to do similar things, repeatedly, multiple times, and avoid code duplication by copy-pasting (nearly the same) chunks of code over and over. You could think of iteration as generalizing those repetitions even further. Instead of manually calling a bit of code repeatedly, we can iterate over that code in an iterative way.\nIn general, there are two types of loops:\n\n1. Loops producing a value for each iteration\nThe loops in this category which we are going to encounter most often are those of the apply family, like lapply() or sapply(). The general pattern like this:\n\nresult &lt;- lapply(&lt;vector/list of values&gt;, &lt;function&gt;)\n\nThe lapply and sapply functions take, at minimum, a vector or a list as their first argument, and then a function which takes a single argument. Then they apply the given function to each element of the vector/list, and return either a list (if we use the lapply() function) or a vector (if we use the sapply() function).\nLet’s consider this more concrete example:\n\ninput_list &lt;- list(\"hello\", \"this\", 123, \"is\", \"a mixed\", 42, \"list\")\n\nresult_list &lt;- lapply(input_list, is.numeric)\n\nresult_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n[[2]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[4]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n[[5]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n[[6]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[7]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nWe took an input_list and applied a function to each element, automatically, gathering the results in another list!\n\nCreate the following function which, for a given number, returns TRUE if this number is even and FALSE if the number is odd. Then use sapply() to test which of the following numbers in the input_vector is odd or even. Notice that we can do thousands or even millions of operations like this (for very very long input vectors) with a single sapply() command!\n\ninput_vector &lt;- c(23, 11, 8, 36, 47, 6, 66, 94, 20, 2)\n\nis_even &lt;- function(x) {\n  x %% 2 == 0 # this answers the question \"does x divided by 2 give 0?\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first test our custom-made function on a couple of examples. This is always a good idea when we want to do iteration using lapply() / sapply().\n\nis_even(2)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_even(7)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_even(10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_even(11)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nNow we apply is_even to every element of our input_vector:\n\nresult &lt;- sapply(input_vector, is_even)\nresult\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a practice of indexing, use the result of the sapply() you just got to filter the input_vector values to only odd numbers.\nHint: Remember that you can negate any TRUE / FALSE value (even vector) using the ! operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this is how we detected which numbers are even:\n\neven_numbers &lt;- sapply(input_vector, is_even)\neven_numbers\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nThis is how we can flip this vector to get odd number indices:\n\nodd_numbers &lt;- !even_numbers\nodd_numbers\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAnd finally, this is how we can filter the original vector to only numbers that are odd:\n\ninput_vector[odd_numbers]\n\n[1] 23 11 47\n\n\nHere’s a secret: there’s a much quicker way to do this, even without looping, utilizing the fact that many operations can be performed on vectors in a “vectorized” way (for every element at the same time):\nThis gives us even numbers right away:\n\ninput_vector %% 2 != 0\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nThis is how we can do the filtering in one go:\n\ninput_vector[input_vector %% 2 != 0]\n\n[1] 23 11 47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese examples are perhaps too boring to see immediate usefulness of sapply() and lapply() for real-world applications. In later sessions, we will see more complex (and more useful) applications of these functions in daily data analysis tasks.\nThat said, you can hopefully see how automating an action of many things at once can be very useful means to save yourself repeated typing of the same command over and over. Again, consider a situation in which you have thousands or even millions of data points!\n\n2. Loops which don’t necessarily return a value\nThis category of loops most often takes form of a for loop, which generally have the following shape:\n\nfor (&lt;item&gt; in &lt;vector or list&gt;) {\n  ... some commands ...\n}\n\nThe most trivial runnable example I could think of is this:\n\n# \"input\" vector of x values\nxs &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n\n# take each x out of all given xs in sequence...\nfor (x in xs) {\n  # ... and print it out on a new line\n  cat(\"The square of\", x, \"is\", x^2, \"\\n\")\n}\n\nThe square of 1 is 1 \nThe square of 2 is 4 \nThe square of 3 is 9 \nThe square of 4 is 16 \nThe square of 5 is 25 \nThe square of 6 is 36 \nThe square of 7 is 49 \nThe square of 8 is 64 \nThe square of 9 is 81 \nThe square of 10 is 100 \n\n\nNote: cat() is a very useful function which prints out a given value (or here, actually, multiple values!). If we append \"\\n\" it will add an (invisible) “new line” character, equivalent of hitting ENTER on your keyboard when writing.\n\nLet’s say you want to automate the plotting of several numeric variables from your penguins data frame to a PDF using your custom-defined function penguin_hist() you created above. Fill in the necessary bits of code in the following template to do this! This is a super common pattern that comes in handy very often in data science work.\nNote: You can see the cat() call in the body of the for loop (we call the insides of the { ... } block the “body” of a loop). When you iterate over many things, it’s very useful to print out this sort of “log” information, particularly if the for loop can take very long.\n\n# create an empty PDF file\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\n# let's define our variables of interest (columns of a data frame)\n# ... put your code here ...\n\n# let's now \"loop over\" each of those variables\nfor (var in variables) {\n# ... put your plotting code here ...\n}\n\ndev.off() # this closes the PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# create an empty PDF file\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\n# let's define our variables of interest (columns of a data frame)\nvariables &lt;- c(\"bill_len\", \"bill_dep\", \"flipper_len\", \"body_mass\")\n\n# let's now \"loop over\" each of those variables\nfor (var in variables) {\n  cat(\"Plotting variable\", var, \"...\\n\")\n  # ... here is where you should put your call to `penguin_hist()` like\n  #     you did above manually ...\n}\n## Plotting variable bill_len ...\n## Plotting variable bill_dep ...\n## Plotting variable flipper_len ...\n## Plotting variable body_mass ...\n\ndev.off() # this closes the PDF\n## quartz_off_screen \n##                 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything works correctly, look at the penguins_hist.pdf file you just created! It was all done in a fully automated way! A hugely important thing for reproducibility.\n\nIf you want, look up ?pdf to see how you could modify the width and height of the figures that will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\nvariables &lt;- c(\"bill_len\", \"bill_dep\", \"flipper_len\", \"body_mass\")\nfor (var in variables) {\n  penguin_hist(penguins, var, 100)  \n}\n\ndev.off()\n## quartz_off_screen \n##                 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther practice\nIf you have energy and time, take a look at the following chapters of the freely-available Advanced R textbook (the best resource for R programming out there). First work through the quiz at the beginning of each chapter. If you’re not sure about answers (the questions are very hard, so if you can’t answer them, that’s completely OK), work through the material of each chapter and try to solve the exercises.\n\nNames and values\nVectors\nSubsetting\nControl flow\nFunctions\n\nPick whichever topic seems interesting to you. Don’t try to ingest everything – even isolated little bits and details that stick with you will pay off in the long run!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, we have a very useful built-in function summary(), which does exactly that. But let’s ignore this for the moment, for learning purposes.",

    "section": "Exercise 9: Functions",
    "text": "Exercise 9: Functions\nThe motivation for this Exercise could be summarized by an ancient motto of programming: Don’t repeat yourself (DRY): “[…] a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.”.\nLet’s demonstrate this idea in practice.\nLet’s say you have the following numeric vector (these could be base qualities, genotype qualities, \\(f\\)-statistics, sequencing coverage, anything):\n\nvec &lt;- c(0.32, 0.78, 0.68, 0.28, 1.96, 0.21, 0.07, 1.01, 0.06, 0.74,\n         0.37, 0.6, 0.08, 1.81, 0.65, 1.23, 1.28, 0.11, 1.74,  1.68)\n\nWith numeric vectors, we often need to compute some summary statistics (mean, median, quartile, minimum, maximum, etc.). What’s more, in a given project, we often have to do this computation multiple times in a number of places.\n\nHere is how we can compute those summary statistics individually:\n\nmin(vec)\n\n[1] 0.06\n\n# first quartile (a value which is higher than the bottom 25% of the data)\nquantile(vec, probs = 0.25)\n\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\nmedian(vec)\n\n[1] 0.665\n\nmean(vec)\n\n[1] 0.783\n\n# third quartile (a value which is higher than the bottom 75% of the data)\nquantile(vec, probs = 0.75)\n\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\nmax(vec)\n\n[1] 1.96\n\n\nNow, you can imagine that you have many more of such vectors (results for different sequenced samples, different computed population genetic metrics, etc.). Having to type out all of these commands for every single one of those vectors would very quickly get extremely tiresome. Worse still, when we would do this, we would certainly resort to copy-pasting, which is guaranteed to lead to errors.\n\nWrite a custom function called my_summary, which will accept a single input named values, and returns a list which binds all the six summary statistics together. Name the elements of that list as \"min\", \"quartile_1\", \"median\", \"mean\", \"quartile_3\", and \"max\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is how we could write the function:\n\nmy_summary &lt;- function(values) {\n  a &lt;- min(vec)\n  b &lt;- quantile(vec, probs = 0.25)\n  c &lt;- median(vec)\n  d &lt;- mean(vec)\n  e &lt;- quantile(vec, probs = 0.75)\n  f &lt;- max(vec)\n  \n  result &lt;- list(min = a, quartile_1 = b, median = c, mean = d, quartile_3 = e, max = f)\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n\nAlthough I would probably prefer to write it a bit more tersely like this:\n\nmy_summary &lt;- function(values) {\n  result &lt;- list(\n    min = min(vec),\n    quartile_1 = quantile(vec, probs = 0.25),\n    median = median(vec),\n    mean = mean(vec),\n    quartile_3 = quantile(vec, probs = 0.75),\n    max = max(vec)\n  )\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, we had to write the code anyway, we even had to do the extra work of wrapping it inside other code (the function body, name the one input argument values, which could be multiple arguments for more complex function). So, one could argue that we didn’t actually save any time. However, that code is now “encapsulated” in a fully self-contained form and can be called repeatably, without any copy-pasting.\nIn other words, if you now create these three vectors of numeric values:\n\nvec1 &lt;- runif(10)\nvec2 &lt;- runif(10)\nvec3 &lt;- runif(10)\n\nYou can now compute our summary statistics by calling our function my_summary() on these vectors, without any code repetition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_summary(vec1)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\nmy_summary(vec2)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\nmy_summary(vec3)\n\n$min\n[1] 0.06\n\n$quartile_1\n   25% \n0.2625 \n\n$median\n[1] 0.665\n\n$mean\n[1] 0.783\n\n$quartile_3\n   75% \n1.2425 \n\n$max\n[1] 1.96\n\n\nAnd, surprise! This is what the incredibly useful built-in function summary() provided with every R installation does!\n\nsummary(vec1)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

This is always a good idea when we want to do iteration using lapply() / sapply().\n\nis_even(2)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_even(7)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_even(10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis_even(11)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nNow we apply is_even to every element of our input_vector:\n\nresult &lt;- sapply(input_vector, is_even)\nresult\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a practice of indexing, use the result of the sapply() you just got to filter the input_vector values to only odd numbers.\nHint: Remember that you can negate any TRUE / FALSE value (even vector) using the ! operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this is how we detected which numbers are even:\n\neven_numbers &lt;- sapply(input_vector, is_even)\neven_numbers\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nThis is how we can flip this vector to get odd number indices:\n\nodd_numbers &lt;- !even_numbers\nodd_numbers\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAnd finally, this is how we can filter the original vector to only numbers that are odd:\n\ninput_vector[odd_numbers]\n\n[1] 23 11 47\n\n\nHere’s a secret: there’s a much quicker way to do this, even without looping, utilizing the fact that many operations can be performed on vectors in a “vectorized” way (for every element at the same time):\nThis gives us even numbers right away:\n\ninput_vector %% 2 != 0\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nThis is how we can do the filtering in one go:\n\ninput_vector[input_vector %% 2 != 0]\n\n[1] 23 11 47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese examples are perhaps too boring to see immediate usefulness of sapply() and lapply() for real-world applications. In later sessions, we will see more complex (and more useful) applications of these functions in daily data analysis tasks.\nThat said, you can hopefully see how automating an action of many things at once can be very useful means to save yourself repeated typing of the same command over and over. Again, consider a situation in which you have thousands or even millions of data points!\n\n2. Loops which don’t necessarily return a value\nThis category of loops most often takes form of a for loop, which generally have the following shape:\n\nfor (&lt;item&gt; in &lt;vector or list&gt;) {\n  ... some commands ...\n}\n\nThe most trivial runnable example I could think of is this:\n\n# \"input\" vector of x values\nxs &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n\n# take each x out of all given xs in sequence...\nfor (x in xs) {\n  # ... and print it out on a new line\n  cat(\"The square of\", x, \"is\", x^2, \"\\n\")\n}\n\nThe square of 1 is 1 \nThe square of 2 is 4 \nThe square of 3 is 9 \nThe square of 4 is 16 \nThe square of 5 is 25 \nThe square of 6 is 36 \nThe square of 7 is 49 \nThe square of 8 is 64 \nThe square of 9 is 81 \nThe square of 10 is 100 \n\n\nNote: cat() is a very useful function which prints out a given value (or here, actually, multiple values!). If we append \"\\n\" it will add an (invisible) “new line” character, equivalent of hitting ENTER on your keyboard when writing.\n\nLet’s say you want to automate the plotting of several numeric variables from your penguins data frame to a PDF using your custom-defined function penguin_hist() you created above. Fill in the necessary bits of code in the following template to do this! This is a super common pattern that comes in handy very often in data science work.\nNote: You can see the cat() call in the body of the for loop (we call the insides of the { ... } block the “body” of a loop). When you iterate over many things, it’s very useful to print out this sort of “log” information, particularly if the for loop can take very long.\n\n# create an empty PDF file\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\n# let's define our variables of interest (columns of a data frame)\n# ... put your code here ...\n\n# let's now \"loop over\" each of those variables\nfor (var in variables) {\n# ... put your plotting code here ...\n}\n\ndev.off() # this closes the PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# create an empty PDF file\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\n# let's define our variables of interest (columns of a data frame)\nvariables &lt;- c(\"bill_len\", \"bill_dep\", \"flipper_len\", \"body_mass\")\n\n# let's now \"loop over\" each of those variables\nfor (var in variables) {\n  cat(\"Plotting variable\", var, \"...\\n\")\n  # ... here is where you should put your call to `penguin_hist()` like\n  #     you did above manually ...\n}\n## Plotting variable bill_len ...\n## Plotting variable bill_dep ...\n## Plotting variable flipper_len ...\n## Plotting variable body_mass ...\n\ndev.off() # this closes the PDF\n## quartz_off_screen \n##                 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything works correctly, look at the penguins_hist.pdf file you just created! It was all done in a fully automated way! A hugely important thing for reproducibility.\n\nIf you want, look up ?pdf to see how you could modify the width and height of the figures that will be created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\npdf(\"penguins_hist.pdf\")\n\nvariables &lt;- c(\"bill_len\", \"bill_dep\", \"flipper_len\", \"body_mass\")\nfor (var in variables) {\n  penguin_hist(penguins, var, 100)  \n}\n\ndev.off()\n## quartz_off_screen \n##                 2",

The following command will read a metadata table with information about individuals published in a recent aDNA paper on the history or the Holocene in West Eurasia, dubbed “MesoNeo” (reference). Please take a couple of minutes to skim the paper to get an idea about the sort of data we will be using during our exercises.\nIf you work with anything related to human history, you’ll probably become closely familiar with this study at some point.\nWe will read the metadata of individual sequenced as part of this paper using the read_tsv() function (from the above-mentioned readr package), and store the loaded table in a variable df. Everything in the exercises in this session will revolve around working with this data because it represents an excellent example of the kind of metadata table you will find across the entirety of computational population genomics, archaeology, ecology, and other fields which deal with spatial and temporal data.\nYes, this function is quite magical – it can read stuff from a file stored on the internet. If you’re curious about the file itself, just paste the URL address in your browser. Even though R gives us superpowers in analyzing data, it’s never a bad thing to rely on more mundane ways to look at the information we’re dealing with.\n\ndf &lt;- read_tsv(\"https://tinyurl.com/simgen-metadata\")\n\n\nIn addition to the brief overview from the slides for this exercise session and looking up documentation to functions via R’s ? help system, I highly encourage you to refer to this chapter of the R for Data Science text book. If you ever need help, it’s a good idea to get into the habit of referring to primary resources. I keep this book at hand every time I work with R.\n\nCreate a new R script in RStudio, (File -&gt; New file -&gt; R Script) and save it somewhere on your computer as tidy-basics.R (File -&gt; Save). Put the library() calls and the read_tsv() command above in this script, and let’s get started!",

Also, don’t forget to use the ?function command in the R console to look up the documentation to see the possibilities for options and additional features, or even just to refresh your memory. Every time I look up the ? help for a function I’ve been using for decade, I always learn new tricks.\n\nBefore we move on, note that when you type df into your R console, you will see a slightly different format of the output than when we worked with plain R data frames in the previous chapter. This format of data frame data is called a “tibble” and represents tidyverse’s more user friendly and modern take on data frames. For almost all practical purposes, from now on, we’ll be talking about tibbles as data frames.",

What is the distribution of dates of aDNA individuals?\nHint: Remember that for a column/vector df$COLUMN_NAME, is.na(df$COLUMN_NAME) gives you TRUE for each NA element in that column variable, and sum(is.na(df$COLUMN_NAME)) counts the number of NA. Alternatively, mean(is.na(df$COLUMN_NAME)) counts the proportion of NA values!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom colnames(df) above we see a number of columns which seem to have something todo with “age”:\n\ncolumns &lt;- colnames(df)\ncolumns\n\n [1] \"sampleId\"     \"popId\"        \"site\"         \"country\"      \"region\"      \n [6] \"continent\"    \"groupLabel\"   \"groupAge\"     \"flag\"         \"latitude\"    \n[11] \"longitude\"    \"dataSource\"   \"age14C\"       \"ageHigh\"      \"ageLow\"      \n[16] \"ageAverage\"   \"datingSource\" \"coverage\"     \"sex\"          \"hgMT\"        \n[21] \"gpAvg\"        \"ageRaw\"       \"hgYMajor\"     \"hgYMinor\"    \n\n\nWe can get those precisely using this trick (don’t worry about this weird command, I’m using it to show you the relevant columns – I’m happy to explain if you’re interested!):\n\ngrep(\"^age.*|^.*Age$\", columns, value = TRUE)\n\n[1] \"groupAge\"   \"age14C\"     \"ageHigh\"    \"ageLow\"     \"ageAverage\"\n[6] \"ageRaw\"    \n\n\nNow let’s take a look at the values available in each of them:\n\nmean(!is.na(df$age14C))\n\n[1] 0.2119352\n\nmean(!is.na(df$ageHigh))\n\n[1] 0.404224\n\nmean(!is.na(df$ageLow))\n\n[1] 0.404224\n\nmean(!is.na(df$ageAverage))\n\n[1] 0.4093811\n\nmean(!is.na(df$ageRaw))\n\n[1] 0.09675835\n\nunique(df$groupAge)\n\n[1] \"Modern\"  \"Ancient\" \"Archaic\"\n\n\nInteresting, it looks like the ageAverage variable has the highest proportion of non-NA values at about 40.94%. We also seem to have another column, groupAge which clusters individuals into three groups. We’ll stick to these two variables whenever we have a question regarding a date of an individual.\n\n\n\nHow many ancient individuals do we have? How many “modern” (i.e., present-day humans) individuals?\nHint: Use the fact that for any vector (and df$groupAge is a vector, remember!), we can get the number of elements of that vector matching a certain value by applying the sum() function on a “conditional” expression, like df$groupAge == \"Ancient\" (which, on its own, gives TRUE / FALSE vector). In other words, in a TRUE / FALSE vector, each TRUE represents 1, and each FALSE represents 0. Obviously then, summing up such vector simply adds all the 1s together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nGet logical vector of which individual’s groupAge value is equal to “Ancient”:\n\nwhich_ancient &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Ancient\"\n\nIndeed this gave us a logical vector:\n\nhead(which_ancient)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1 and 0 vector under the hood:\n\nhead(as.integer(which_ancient))\n\n[1] 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nAnd this means we can sum it like this:\n\nsum(which_ancient)\n\n[1] 1664\n\n\nWe can do the same for “Modern” and “Archaic” individuals:\n\nwhich_modern &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Modern\"\nsum(which_modern)\n\n[1] 2405\n\n\n\nwhich_archaic &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Archaic\"\nsum(which_archaic)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are the mysterious “Archaic” individuals? What are their names (sampleId, column) and which publications they come frome (dataSource column)?\nHint: We need to filter our table down to rows which have groupAge == \"Archaic\". This is an indexing operation which you learned about in the R bootcamp session! Remember that data frames can be indexed into along two dimensions: rows and columns. You want to filter by the rows here using a logical vector obtained by df$groupAge == \"Archaic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this gets us a logical vector which has TRUE for each element corresponding to an “Archaic” individual (whoever that might be):\n\nwhich_archaic &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Archaic\"\nhead(which_archaic)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nAnd we can then use this vector as an index into our overall data frame, just like we learned in the bootcamp session:\n\narchaic_df &lt;- df[which_archaic, ]\narchaic_df$sampleId\n\n[1] \"Vindija33.19\"    \"AltaiNeandertal\" \"Denisova\"       \n\n\nOur mysterious “Archaic” individuals are two Neanderthals and a Denisovan!\nHere are the publications:\n\narchaic_df$dataSource\n\n[1] \"Prufer_Science_2017\" \"Prufer_Nature_2014\"  \"Pruefer_2017\"       \n\n\n\n\n\nDo we have geographical information in our metadata? Maybe countries or geographical coordinates (or even both)? Which countries do we have individuals from? (We’ll talk about spatial data science later in detail, so let’s interpret whatever geographical variable columns we have in our data frame df as any other numerical or string column variable.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at colnames(df) we have a number of columns which have something to do with geography: country, region, and also the traditional longitude and latitude coordinates.\nHow can we get an idea about the distribution of countries? table() counts the number of elements in a vector (basically, a histogram without plotting it), sort() then sorts those elements for easier reading:\n\nsort(table(df$country), decreasing = TRUE)\n\n\n         India          China         Russia          Italy        Nigeria \n           394            308            285            256            207 \n       Denmark         Sweden             UK          Spain         Gambia \n           184            174            167            132            114 \n           USA        Vietnam          Japan     PuertoRico        Finland \n           108            108            107            104            102 \n         Kenya       Barbados       Pakistan       Colombia           Peru \n            98             96             96             94             91 \n   SierraLeone         Mexico     Kazakhstan        Estonia        Ukraine \n            85             67             64             60             60 \n        Poland         France         Norway        Hungary        Iceland \n            56             54             42             41             40 \n    Kyrgyzstan         Turkey        Lebanon       Portugal        Ireland \n            39             22             19             18             16 \n        Faroes        Germany      Greenland        Moldova  CzechRepublic \n            15             12             11             10              9 \n  South Africa           Iran         Latvia        Romania        Armenia \n             9              8              7              7              6 \n        Canada         Serbia      Argentina         Brazil Canary Islands \n             6              6              5              5              5 \n      Mongolia          Chile        Georgia           Laos       Malaysia \n             5              4              4              4              4 \n      Thailand   Turkmenistan         Greece       Cameroon      Indonesia \n             4              4              3              2              2 \n       Croatia       Ethiopia      Lithuania     Luxembourg    Philippines \n             1              1              1              1              1 \n      Slovakia    Switzerland \n             1              1 \n\n\n\nsort(table(df$region), decreasing = TRUE)\n\n\n      NorthernEurope            SouthAsia             EastAsia \n                 635                  489                  420 \n      SouthernEurope           WestAfrica         NorthAmerica \n                 409                  406                  382 \nCentralEasternEurope        WesternEurope         SouthAmerica \n                 330                  251                  199 \n           NorthAsia        SouthEastAsia          CentralAsia \n                 146                  124                  107 \n          EastAfrica          WesternAsia          SouthAfrica \n                  99                   59                    9 \n         NorthAfrica        CentralAfrica \n                   5                    2 \n\n\nWe will ignore longitude and latitude for now, because they are most useful in truly geographical data analysis setting (which we will delve into a bit later).\n\n\n\nWhat is the source of the sequences in our data set (i.e., which are the publications the individuals’ sequences come from)?

of individuals from a wide range of other publications. This is great because it allows us to refer individual specific results we might obtain later to the respective publications!\n\n\n\nWhat’s the distribution of coverage of the samples (you now know which column has the coverage information)? Compute the mean() and other summary() statistics on the coverage information. Why doesn’t the mean() function work when you run it on the vector of numbers in the coverage column (i.e, df$coverage, use ?mean to find the solution). Which individuals have missing coverage? Finally, use the hist() function to visualize this information to get a rough idea about the data.\nThese are all basic (maybe a bit boring) questions which you will be asking yourself every time you read a new table into R. It might not always be coverage, but you will have to do this to familiarize yourself with the data and understand its potential issues!\nAlways keep an eye on strange outliers, missing data NA, anything suspicious. Never take any data for granted (that applies both to data from any third parties, but even to your own data sets!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nMean gives us NA:\n\nmean(df$coverage)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThis is because computing the mean from a vector containing NA values is not a sensible operation – should we remove the NA values? It’s impossible to say in general, because that would depend on the nature of our data. Sometimes, encountering NA indicates a problem, so we can’t just ignore it. In situation when this is OK, there’s a argument which changes the default behavior and removes the NA elements before computing the mean:\n\nmean(df$coverage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.623767\n\n\nSummary takes care of the issue by reporting the number of NA values explicitly:\n\nsummary(df$coverage)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0124  0.2668  0.7824  1.6238  1.5082 58.8661    2405 \n\n\nWe can see that the coverage information is missing for 2405 individuals, which is the number of individuals in the (present-day) 1000 Genomes Project data. So it makes sense, we only have coverage for the lower-coverage aDNA samples, but for present-day individuals (who have imputed genomes), the coverage does not even make sense here.\nLet’s plot the coverage values:\n\nhist(df$coverage, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is the oldest individuals in our data set? Who has the highest coverage? Who has the lowest coverage? Again, the “age of a sample” here is just a place holder — in practice you’ll be asking yourselves this kind of questions for all kinds of statistics, even statistics you have to obtain from third-party inference software.\nHint: Use functions min(), max() or which.min(), which.max(). When would you use each of the pair of functions? Look up their ?help to understand what they do and how to use them in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich.max() reports the index (in this case, the row number) of the maximum value in a vector (in this case, a column vector):\n\nwhich.max(df$ageAverage)\n\n[1] 4071\n\n\nThis means we can use this number to index into the data frame and find our answer:\n\ndf[which.max(df$ageAverage), ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 24\n  sampleId        popId site  country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 AltaiNeandertal Alta… Deni… Russia  North… Asia      Neanderta… Archaic  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\nmax(df$ageAverage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 125000\n\n\nLet’s use the similar approach for coverage:\n\ndf[which.min(df$coverage), ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 24\n  sampleId popId  site        country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NEO496   NEO496 Vasilevka-I Ukraine Centr… Europe    Ukraine_M… Ancient  lowc…\n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\nmin(df$coverage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.01239792\n\ndf[which.max(df$coverage), ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 24\n  sampleId popId site         country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 sf12     sf12  Stora F√∂rv… Sweden  North… Europe    Sweden_Me… Ancient  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\nmax(df$coverage, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 58.8661",

    "text": "Exercise 2: Selecting columns\nWe have now some basic familiarity with the format of our data and which kinds of variables/columns we have for every individual. It’s time to learn about techniques for manipulating, modifying, and filtering this data.\nOften times we end up in a situation in which we don’t want to have a large data frame with a huge number of columns. Not as much for the reasons of the data taking up too much memory, but for convenience. You can see that our df metadata table has 24 columns, which don’t fit on the screen if we just print it out (note the “13 more variables” in the output). Just try this yourself again in your R console and observe what kind of (cluttered) output you get:\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 24\n   sampleId popId site  country region     continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 NA18486  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 2 NA18488  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 3 NA18489  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 4 NA18498  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 5 NA18499  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 6 NA18501  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 7 NA18502  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 8 NA18504  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n 9 NA18505  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n10 NA18507  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nWe can select which columns to pick from a (potentially very large data frame) with the function select(). It has the following general format:\nselect(&lt;data frame&gt;, &lt;column 1&gt;, &lt;column 2&gt;, ...)\nAs a reminder, this is how we would select columns using a normal base R subsetting/indexing operation:\n\nsmaller_df &lt;- df[, c(\"sampleId\", \"region\", \"coverage\", \"ageAverage\")]\n\nsmaller_df\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 4\n   sampleId region     coverage ageAverage\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 NA18486  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 2 NA18488  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 3 NA18489  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 4 NA18498  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 5 NA18499  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 6 NA18501  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 7 NA18502  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 8 NA18504  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 9 NA18505  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n10 NA18507  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\nThis is the tidyverse approach using select():\n\nsmaller_df &lt;- select(df, sampleId, region, coverage, ageAverage)\n\nsmaller_df\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 4\n   sampleId region     coverage ageAverage\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 NA18486  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 2 NA18488  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 3 NA18489  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 4 NA18498  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 5 NA18499  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 6 NA18501  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 7 NA18502  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 8 NA18504  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n 9 NA18505  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n10 NA18507  WestAfrica       NA         NA\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\nNote the most important thing for you to notice, which is the absence of “double quotes”. It might not look like much, but saving yourself from having to type double quotes for every data-frame operation (like with base R) is incredibly convenient.\n\nPractice select() by creating three new data frame objects (remember that you can assign a result to a variable using the &lt;- operator):\n\nData frame df_ages which contains all variables related to sample ages\nData frame df_geo which contains all variables related to geography\n\nAdditionally, the first column of these data frames should always be sampleId, so make sure this column is included in the selection.\nCheck visually (or using the ncol() functions) that you indeed have a smaller number of columns in your new data frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_ages &lt;- select(df, sampleId, groupAge, age14C, ageHigh, ageLow, ageAverage, ageRaw)\ndf_ages\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 7\n   sampleId groupAge age14C ageHigh ageLow ageAverage ageRaw\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 NA18486  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 2 NA18488  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 3 NA18489  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 4 NA18498  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 NA18499  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 6 NA18501  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 7 NA18502  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 8 NA18504  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 9 NA18505  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 NA18507  Modern       NA      NA     NA         NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\n\ndf_geo &lt;- select(df, site, country, region, latitude, longitude)\ndf_geo\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 5\n   site  country region     latitude longitude\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 5 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 6 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 7 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n10 &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica       NA        NA\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: select() allows us to see the contents of columns of interest much easier. For instance, in a situation in which we want to analyse the geographical location of samples, we don’t want to see columns unrelated to that (like haplogrous, sex of an individual, etc. which are all part of the huge original table) and select() is the solution to this.\n\nIf your tables has many columns of interest, typing them all by hand like you did in the select() examples above can become tiresome real quick. Here are a few helper functions which can be very useful in that situation:\n\nstarts_with(\"age\") – matches columns starting with the string “age”\nends_with(\"age\") – matches columns ending with the string “age”\ncontains(\"age\") – matches columns containing the string “age”\n\nNote: You can use them in place of normal column names. If we would modify our select() “template” above, we could do this, for instance:\nselect(df, starts_with(\"text1\"), ends_with(\"text2\"))\nCheck out the ?help belonging to those functions (note that they have ignore.case = TRUE set by default!). Then create the df_ages table again, just like earlier, with the same criteria, but use the three helper functions listed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_ages1 &lt;- select(df, sampleId, groupAge, age14C, ageHigh, ageLow, ageAverage, ageRaw)\n\ndf_ages2 &lt;- select(df,\n                   sampleId,\n                   starts_with(\"age\", ignore.case = FALSE),\n                   ends_with(\"Age\", ignore.case = FALSE))",

    "text": "Exercise 3: Filtering rows\nIn the chapter on base R, we learned how to filter rows using the indexing operation along the row-based dimension of (two-dimensional) data frames. For instance, in order to find out which individuals in the metadata are archaics, we first created a TRUE / FALSE vector of the rows corresponding to those individuals like this:\n\n# get a vector of the indices belonging to archaic individuals\nwhich_archaic &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Archaic\"\n\n# take a peek at the result to make sure we got TRUE / FALSE vector\ntail(which_archaic, 10)\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nAnd then we would use it to index into the data frame (in its first dimension, before the , comma):\n\narchaic_df &lt;- df[which_archaic, ]\narchaic_df\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 24\n  sampleId        popId site  country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Vindija33.19    Vind… Vind… Croatia Centr… Europe    Neanderta… Archaic  0    \n2 AltaiNeandertal Alta… Deni… Russia  North… Asia      Neanderta… Archaic  0    \n3 Denisova        Deni… Deni… Russia  North… Asia      Denisova_… Archaic  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nHowever, what if we need to filter on multiple conditions? For instance, what if we want to find all archaic individuals older than 50000 years?\nOne option would be to create multiple TRUE / FALSE vectors, each corresponding to one of those conditions, and then join them into a single logical vector by combining & and | logical operators like you did in the previous chapter on logical expressions. For example, we could do this (try this code yourself to make sure you understand what’s going on):\n\n# who is archaic in our data?\nwhich_archaic &lt;- df$groupAge == \"Archaic\"\n# who is older than 50000 years?\nwhich_old &lt;- df$ageAverage &gt; 50000\n\n# who is BOTH? note the AND logical operator!\nwhich_combined &lt;- which_archaic & which_old\n\n\ndf[which_combined, ]\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 24\n  sampleId        popId site  country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 AltaiNeandertal Alta… Deni… Russia  North… Asia      Neanderta… Archaic  0    \n2 Denisova        Deni… Deni… Russia  North… Asia      Denisova_… Archaic  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nBut this gets tiring very quickly, requires unnecessary amount of typing, and is very error prone. Imagine having to do this for many more conditions! The filter() function from tidyverse again fixes all of these problems.\nWe can rephrase the example situation with the archaics to use the new function filter() like this:\n\nfilter(df, groupAge == \"Archaic\" & ageAverage &gt; 50000)\n\nI hope that, even if you never really programmed much before, you appreciate that this single command involves very little typing and is immediately readable, almost like this English sentence:\n\n“Filter the data frame df for individuals in which column groupAge is”Archaic” and who are older than 50000 years”.\n\nOver time you will see that all of tidyverse packages follow these ergonomic principles.\nHere is the most crucial thing for you to remember! Notice that we refer to columns of our data frame df (like the columns groupAge or ageAverage right above) as if they were normal variables! Just like we did in select() above. In any tidyverse function we don’t write \"groupAge\", but simply groupAge! When you start, you’ll probably make this kind of mistake quite often. So this is a reminder to keep an eye for this.\n\nPractice filtering with the filter() function by finding out which individual(s) in your df metadata table are from a country with the value \"CzechRepublic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter(df, country == \"CzechRepublic\")\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 24\n  sampleId popId   site       country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NEO128   NEO128  Vedrovice  CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Neo… Ancient  lowc…\n2 kol6     kol6    Kol√≠n     CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Neo… Ancient  0    \n3 kol2     kol2    Kol√≠n     CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Neo… Ancient  lowG…\n4 RISE566  RISE566 Knezeves   CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Bro… Ancient  0    \n5 RISE586  RISE586 Moravsk√°… CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Bro… Ancient  0    \n6 RISE577  RISE577 Velk√© P≈… CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Bro… Ancient  0    \n7 DA111    DA111   Lovosice … CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Iro… Ancient  0    \n8 DA112    DA112   Lovosice … CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Iro… Ancient  0    \n9 RISE569  RISE569 Brandysek  CzechR… Centr… Europe    Czech_Iro… Ancient  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich one of these individuals have coverage higher than 1?

    "text": "Exercise 4: The pipe %&gt;%\nThe pipe operator, %&gt;%, is the rockstar of the tidyverse R ecosystem, and the primary reason what makes tidy data workflow so efficient and easy to read.\nFirst, what is “the pipe”?: whenever you see code like this:\n\nsomething%&gt;%f()\n\nyou can read it as:\n\n“take something and put it as the first argument of f()`”.\n\nWhy would you want to do this? Imagine some complex data processing operation like this:\n\nh(f(g(i(j(input_data)))))\n\nThis means take input_data, compute j(input_data), then compute i() on that, so i(j(input_data)), then compute g(i(j(input_data))), etc. Of course this is an extreme example but is surprisingly not that far off from what we often have to do in data science.\nOne way to make this easier to read would be perhaps this:\n\ntmp1 &lt;- j(input_data)\ntmp2 &lt;- i(tmp1)\ntmp3 &lt;- g(tmp2)\ntmp4 &lt;- f(tmp3)\nresult &lt;- f(tmp4)\n\nBut that’s too much typing when we want to get insights into our data as quickly as possible with as little work as possible.\nThe pipe approach of tidyverse would make the same thing easier to write and read like this:\n\ninput_data %&gt;% j %&gt;% i %&gt;% g %&gt;% f %&gt;% h\n\nThis kind of “data transformation chain” is so frequent that RStudio even provides a built-in shortcut for it:\n\nCMD + Shift + M on macOS\nCTRL + Shift + M on Windows and Linux\n\nWheneevr you will pipe something like this in your solutions, always get in the habit of using these shortcuts. Eventually this will allow you to write code as quickly as you can think, trust me!\n\nUse your newly acquired select() and filter() skills, powered by the %&gt;% piping operator, and perform the following transformation on the df metadata table (filter-ing and select-ion operations on the specified columns):\n\nFirst filter() the df metadata to get only those rows / individuals who are:\n\n\n“Ancient” individuals (column groupAge)\nolder than 10000 years (column ageAverage)\nfrom Italy (column country)\nwith coverage column higher than 3\n\n\nThen pipe the result of the filter()-ing above to select() columns: sampleId, site, sex, and hgMT and hgYMajor (mt and Y haplogroups).\n\nAs a practice, try to be as silly as you can and write the entire command with as many uses of filter() and select() function calls in sequence as you can.\nHint: Don’t write the entire pipeline at once! For filter(), start with one condition, evaluate it, then add another one, etc., inspecting the intermediate results as you’re seeing them in the R console after every evaluation from your script (CTRL / CMD + Enter). Alternatively, first build up everything in the console one step at a time, then paste the result into your script to save the command on disk. This is the tidyverse way of doing data science!\nHint: What I mean by this is that the following two commands produce the exact same result:\nnew_df1 &lt;- filter(df, col1 == \"MatchString\", col2 &gt; 10000, col3 == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(colX, colY, starts_with(\"ColNamePrefix\"))\nlike doing this instead:\nnew_df1 &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(col1 == \"MatchString\") %&gt;%\n  filter(col2 &gt; 10000) %&gt;%\n  filter(col3 == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(colX, colY, starts_with(\"ColNamePrefix\"))\nThis works because “the thing on the left” (which is always a data frame) is placed by the %&gt;% pipe operator as “the first argument of a function on the right” (which again expects always a data frame)!\nHopefully you now see what this idea of “build a more complex %&gt;% pipeline one step a time” can mean in practice. Now apply these ideas to solve the exercise in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(groupAge == \"Ancient\") %&gt;%\n  filter(ageAverage &gt; 10000) %&gt;%\n  filter(country == \"Italy\") %&gt;%\n  filter(coverage &gt; 3) %&gt;%\n  select(sampleId, site, sex, hgMT, hgYMajor)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  sampleId site              sex   hgMT              hgYMajor\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 R7       Grotta Continenza XY    U5b1+16189+@16192 I2a     \n\n\nWe could also write the same thing more concisely (not the single filter() call):\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(groupAge == \"Ancient\", ageAverage &gt; 10000, country == \"Italy\", coverage &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  select(sampleId, site, sex, hgMT, hgYMajor)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  sampleId site              sex   hgMT              hgYMajor\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 R7       Grotta Continenza XY    U5b1+16189+@16192 I2a     \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is always a good practice to split long chains of %&gt;% piping commands into multiple lines, and indenting them neatly one after the other.

    "text": "Exercise 7: Renaming columns\nVery often you read data frames in which columns have names which are either very long, containing characters which are not allowed, or generally inconvenient. Imagine a situation, in which you refer to a particular column very often in your workflow, but it takes too much time to type it out.\nAfter discussing select(), filter(), and relocate(), let’s introduce another member of the tidyverse – the function rename().\nThe template for using it is again very easy (again, you would replace the text in &lt;here&gt; with appropriate symbols):\nrename(&lt;data frame&gt;, &lt;new name&gt; = &lt;old name&gt;)\n\nCreate a new data frame df_subset by doing the following:\n\nFirst select() the columns sampleId, popId, country, continent, groupAge, ageAverage, and coverage.\nThen use the rename() function to give them a shorter name: sampleId -&gt; sample, popId -&gt; population, groupAge -&gt; set, ageAverage -&gt; age. Leave the country and coverage columns as they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_subset &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  select(sampleId, popId, country, continent, groupAge, ageAverage, coverage) %&gt;%\n  rename(sample = sampleId, population = popId, set = groupAge, age = ageAverage)\n\ndf_subset\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 7\n   sample  population country continent set      age coverage\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 4 NA18498 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 5 NA18499 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 6 NA18501 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 7 NA18502 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 8 NA18504 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n 9 NA18505 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n10 NA18507 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\nWe now have a much cleaner table which is much easier to work with!\n\n\n\n\nA shortcut which can be quite useful sometimes is that select() also accepts the new_name = old_name syntax of the rename() function, which allows you to both select columns (and rename some of them) all at once.

    "text": "Exercise 8: Reorganizing columns\nLet’s look at another useful application of the select() function and that is reordering columns. Our df metadata table has 24 columns. When we print it out, we only see a couple of them:\n\nhead(df, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 24\n  sampleId popId site  country region     continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NA18486  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n2 NA18488  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n3 NA18489  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nOftentimes when doing data analysis, we often work interactively in the console, focusing on a specific subset of columns, and need to immediately see the values of our columns of interest — how can we do this?\nWe already know that we can use select() to pick those columns of interest, but this removes the non-selected columns from the data frame we get. Whenever we want to retain them, we can add the call to everything(), like this:\nselect(&lt;data frame&gt;, &lt;column 1&gt;, &lt;column 2&gt;, ..., everything())\nWhich effectively moves &lt;column 1&gt;, &lt;column 2&gt;, … to the “front” of our table, and adds everything else at the end.\nSelect the subset of columns you selected in the previous exercise on renaming in exactly the same way, but this time add a call to everything() at the end to keep the entire data set intact (with just columns rearranged). Save the result to df again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data frame before:\n\nhead(df, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 24\n  sampleId popId site  country region     continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NA18486  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n2 NA18488  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n3 NA18489  YRI   &lt;NA&gt;  Nigeria WestAfrica Africa    YRI        Modern   0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- select(df, sample = sampleId, population = popId, country, continent,\n             set = groupAge, age = ageAverage, coverage,\n             everything())\n\nOur data frame after:\n\nhead(df, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 24\n  sample  population country continent set      age coverage site  region    \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa    Modern    NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n# ℹ 15 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNotice that we prioritized the selected columns of interest (and also renamed some for more readability), but we still have all the other columns available!\n\n\n\n\nExperiment with the function relocate(). Try it with our df table and with giving it a names of a couple of columns, similarly to what you did with select() above.

    "section": "Exercise 11: Mutating tables",
    "text": "Exercise 11: Mutating tables\nMutating a table means adding a column for a new variable. Again, as with the previously introduced functions select(), filter(), and rename() and arrange(), it follows a consistent tidyverse pattern:\ndf %&gt;% mutate(&lt;new column name&gt; = &lt;vector of the required length&gt;)\nNot surprisingly, the new column is assigned a vector of the same length as the number of rows in a data frame. What we often do is this:\ndf %&gt;% mutate(&lt;new column name&gt; = &lt;expression involving other columns&gt;)\nbecause mutate() allows us to refer to other columns in the data frame already present.\n\nTo demonstrate this on a couple of exercises, let’s actually remove some columns from our data frame first. They were originally created by mutate() in the first place and this gives as a useful opportunity for practice:\n\ndf &lt;- select(df, -set)\n\nDon’t worry, we’ll be adding them back soon using our custom code.\nThe important aspect of mutate is that it is a vectorized operation. We can’t create a column and give values to only some rows. Here are several ways how we could do this:\n\n1. if_else()\nif_else() accepts a logical vector (i.e., a vector of TRUE / FALSE values), and produces another vector which contains one value for each TRUE, and another value for each FALSE. Here is an example:\n\nv &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\nif_else(v, 1, -1)\n\n[1]  1  1 -1  1 -1\n\n\nNotice that we get 1 for each TRUE and -1 for each FALSE.\n\nThis can be a bit confusing, so spend a bit of time playing around with if_else(). For instance, create a different logical vector (with an arbitrary TRUE or FALSE values, up to you), and have the function produce values “hello” and “bye” depending on TRUE / FALSE state of each element. Just get familiar with this vectorized thinking because whenever we do data science, it almost always happens in this vectorized fashion (such as operating on every single value in a column of a table at once).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv &lt;- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\nif_else(v, \"hello\", \"bye\")\n\n[1] \"bye\"   \"bye\"   \"bye\"   \"hello\" \"hello\" \"bye\"   \"hello\" \"bye\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function is extremely useful whenever we need to generate values of a new column based on values of another column(s). The general pattern for using it inside a mutate() call is this:\ndf %&gt;%\n  mutate(&lt;new_column&gt; = if_else(&lt;logical vector&gt;, value_for_true, value_for_false))\n\nYou can see that the column df$sex contains chromosome sex determination of each individual as either XY or XX. Use the if_else() function in a mutate() call to create a new column sex_desc which will contain a character vector of either “male” or “female” depending on the sex chromosome determination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, sex_desc = if_else(sex == \"XY\", \"male\", \"female\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nRun table(df$sex, df$sex_value) to make sure the assignment of sex description worked as expected. How do you interpret the results? Did we miss something? If we did, what is wrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, we can see that there’s an “XXY” individual who – because of our improperly specified if_else() condition (which assigns individuals as male only when they are “XY”) – got assigned in to the “female” category.\n\ntable(df$sex, df$sex_desc)\n\n     \n      female male\n  XX    1862    0\n  XXY      1    0\n  XY       0 2209\n\n\nWe would’ve noticed this in our exploratory phase, had we checked the range of possible values of the sex column like this. This is why getting familiar with all data is so crucial the first time we look at it. We could’ve (and should’ve) ran this at the beginning:\n\ntable(df$sex)\n\n\n  XX  XXY   XY \n1862    1 2209 \n\nunique(df$sex)\n\n[1] \"XY\"  \"XX\"  \"XXY\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out there is an individual with a Klinefelter syndrome. A male carrying an extra X chromosome. Clearly the logic of our if_else() is incorrect because this individual was incorrectly assigned as “female”. How would you fix the mutate() (or rather the if_else()) command to work correctly and correctly assign the XXY individual as “male”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of options. This is simplest, we can just flip the condition:\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, sex_desc = if_else(sex == \"XX\", \"female\", \"male\"))\n\nBut it may be better to be more explicit?\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, sex_desc = if_else(sex %in% c(\"XY\", \"XXY\"), \"male\", \"female\"))\n\nWe can verify that the assignment of sex description worked correctly now:\n\ntable(df$sex, df$sex_desc)\n\n     \n      female male\n  XX    1862    0\n  XXY      0    1\n  XY       0 2209\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a lesson to always remember to check assumptions in your data, even the ones you consider trivial. Functions such as table() and unique() are extremely useful for this.\nNote: I got this originally wrong when I was preparing these materials.\n\nLet’s practice if_else() a bit more. First, use filter() to look at the values of the age column for present-day individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project data (dataSource == \"1000g\"). What ages do you see?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe individuals have NA age. This could be annoying if we ever want to plot some population genetic statistics as functions of age:\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(dataSource == \"1000g\")\n\n# A tibble: 2,405 × 24\n   sample  population country continent   age coverage site  region   groupLabel\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 4 NA18498 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 5 NA18499 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 6 NA18501 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 7 NA18502 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 8 NA18504 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n 9 NA18505 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n10 NA18507 YRI        Nigeria Africa       NA       NA &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfr… YRI       \n# ℹ 2,395 more rows\n# ℹ 15 more variables: flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;, ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nIs there anyone in the 1000 GP data who has an age specified?\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(dataSource == \"1000g\") %&gt;% filter(!is.na(age))\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 24\n# ℹ 24 variables: sample &lt;chr&gt;, population &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   continent &lt;chr&gt;, age &lt;dbl&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, site &lt;chr&gt;, region &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;, ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already know that you can get a logical vector indicating whether a certain element of another vector (here, the column age) is NA or not via the function is.na(). Use is.na(age) in the if_else() to set the age column with the mutate() function so that:\n\nRows where is.na(age) is TRUE will be set to 0, and\nRows where is.na(age) is FALSE will be set to age (because those values don’t need to be replaced).\n\nNote: Using mutate() to replace values of an existing column (rather than creating a new column) is done very often in data science, particularly in “clean up” operations like this one. Your data will never be “perfect” (especially if you get it from some other source) and you will need to do a lot of so-called “table munging” to prepare it for analysis and plotting, just like we’re doing here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe individuals have NA age. This could be annoying if we ever want to plot some population genetic statistics as functions of age:\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(age = if_else(is.na(age), 0, age))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. case_when()\nif_else() does only work on binary TRUE or FALSE conditions. But what if we want to create a new column with values of multiple categories, not just two. Recall our original column set, which had values either “Archaic”, “Ancient”, or “Modern”.\nFor this purpose, case_when() is perfect. It works in a very similar manner to if_else(). Consider this vector of numbers between 1 and 30:\n\nv &lt;- 1:20\n\nIf we wanted to assign a value “less_than_10” or “10_or_more” to each element, we could use the function if_else() like this:\n\nif_else(v &lt; 10, \"less than 10\", \"10 or more\")\n\n [1] \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\"\n [6] \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"less than 10\" \"10 or more\"  \n[11] \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"  \n[16] \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"   \"10 or more\"  \n\n\nWhat if we want to introduce three or more categories? case_when() to the rescue! Try running this yourself on the vector v created above.\n\ncase_when(\n  v &lt; 10  ~ \"less than 5\",\n  v == 10 ~ \"exactly 10\",\n  v &gt; 10 ~ \"more than 10\"\n)\n\n [1] \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\" \n [6] \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"less than 5\"  \"exactly 10\"  \n[11] \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\"\n[16] \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\" \"more than 10\"\n\n\nRemember how we had a slightly annoying time with doing vectorized conditional logical expressions on TRUE / FALSE vectors in our Bootcamp session? Now it’s all paying off!\nEvery one of the three conditions actually result in a logical vector, and case_when() decides which value to produced for each element of that vector based on whichever results in TRUE\nThe case_when() function has a very useful optional argument called .default =, which determines the value it should return whenever a particular location in the logical vector either results in all FALSE (so none of the conditions would apply), or whenever it produces a NA value (so none of the conditions can apply even in principle).\n\nFirst, let’s start simple and reimplement the mutate() operation to add the sex_desc column again, this time using case_when() and implementing the three conditions (“XX”, “XY”, “XXY”) individually. Additionally, use the .default = argument of case_when() to assign “unknown” as a value of the sex_desc column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex_desc = case_when(\n    sex == \"XX\" ~ \"female\",\n    sex == \"XY\" ~ \"male\",\n    sex == \"XXY\" ~ \"male\",\n    .default = \"unknown\"\n  ))\n\nLet’s check that this worked correctly:\n\ntable(df$sex, df$sex_desc)\n\n     \n      female male\n  XX    1862    0\n  XXY      0    1\n  XY       0 2209\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the exercise on conditional expressions, you learned about & and | operators which make it possible to combine multiple conditions into a single TRUE / FALSE vector. Of course, this means that the conditions inside the case_when() function can also utilize those operators.\nCreate a new column sex_set which will contain the following values:\n\nsex == \"XX\" & age == 0\" should produce \"female (present-day)\",\n(sex == \"XY\" | sex == \"XXY\") & age == 0 should produce \"male (present-day)\",\nsex == \"XX\" & age &gt; 0 should produce \"female (ancient)\",\n(sex == \"XY\" | sex == \"XXY\") & age &gt; 0 should produce \"male (ancient)\",\nany other combination should default to “other”\n\nI provided the logical conditions for you, you just have to put them in a case_when() call appropriately, modifying the solution to the previous exercise. Verify the outcome by doing table(df$sex_set) again.\nWhy did I put parenthesis around the sub-clause involving the | OR operator? What happens if we don’t do this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex_set = case_when(\n    sex == \"XX\" & age == 0                   ~ \"female (present-day)\",\n    sex == \"XX\" & age &gt; 0                    ~ \"female (ancient)\",\n    (sex == \"XY\" | sex == \"XXY\") & age == 0  ~ \"male (present-day)\",\n    (sex == \"XY\" | sex == \"XXY\") & age &gt; 0   ~ \"male (ancient)\",\n    .default = \"other\"\n  ))\n\nLet’s check that this worked correctly:\n\ntable(df$sex_set)\n\n\n    female (ancient) female (present-day)       male (ancient) \n                 641                 1221                 1026 \n  male (present-day) \n                1184 \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Again, admittedly this might seem arbitrary to you — why would we need something like this for data analysis and statistics? But this kind of “arbitrary categorization” is extremely useful to generate factor categories for plotting, especially for plotting with ggplot2 later. So keep this in mind for the time being.\n\nRemember how we removed the set column, which originally contained values “Modern”, “Ancient”, or “Archaic”, depending on whether the individual was a present-day modern human, ancient modern human, or an archaic individual, respectively? Use what you learned in this exercise on if_else() or case_when() to reconstruct this column again based on information in the remaining columns. (There is many possible solutions, so don’t be afraid to think creatively!)\nHint: Using information in age and the names of the three archaic individuals (combined with the .default argument of case_when() is probably the easiest solution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# let's pick out individual names of the archaics\narchaics &lt;- c(\"Vindija33.19\", \"AltaiNeandertal\", \"Denisova\")\n\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  mutate(set = case_when(\n    age == 0             ~ \"Modern\",  # whoever has sampling date 0 is \"Modern\"\n    sample %in% archaics ~ \"Archaic\", # whoever is among archaics is \"Archaic\"\n    .default             = \"Ancient\"  # and only the third category remains\n  ),\n  .after = coverage)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of .after = in my solution to the previous exercise.

    "text": "Exercise 12: Summarizing tables\nYou have already learned how to operate on rows (filter(), arrange()), columns (select(), rename()), and both rows and columns (mutate()). We have one remaining piece of the puzzle and that is operating on groups of rows. This takes the tidyverse functionality to an entire whole level and allows you to do many more powerful things with tabular data and compute summary statistics. In this section, we will will cover the functions group_by(), summarize(), and various associated “slice functions”.\n\n1. group_by()\nTake a look at the first couple of rows of our metadata table again:\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 26\n   sample  population country continent   age coverage set    site  region    \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 4 NA18498 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 5 NA18499 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 6 NA18501 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 7 NA18502 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 8 NA18504 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 9 NA18505 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n10 NA18507 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n# ℹ 17 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;, sex_set &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow run the following code in your R console and carefully inspect the output (and compare it to the result of the previous command):\n\ngroup_by(df, continent)\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 26\n# Groups:   continent [4]\n   sample  population country continent   age coverage set    site  region    \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 4 NA18498 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 5 NA18499 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 6 NA18501 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 7 NA18502 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 8 NA18504 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 9 NA18505 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n10 NA18507 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n# ℹ 17 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;, sex_set &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nYou can probably see that the data hasn’t changed at all (same number of columns, same number of rows, all remains the same), but you can notice a new piece of information in the output:\n[...]\n# Groups:   continent [4]\n[...]\nThe output says that the data has been grouped by the column/variable continent. This means that any subsequent operation will be applied not to individual rows, like it was with our mutate() operations earlier, but they will now work “per continent”. You can imagine this as the group_by() function adding a tiny bit of invisible annotation data which instructs downstream functions to work per group.\nBefore we move on to computing summary statistics, let’s also note that we can, of course, group based on multiple columns. For instance, in our data, we should probably not summarize based on continent but also on age, splitting individuals based on the broad age sets like this:\n\ngroup_by(df, continent, set)\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 26\n# Groups:   continent, set [10]\n   sample  population country continent   age coverage set    site  region    \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 NA18486 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 2 NA18488 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 3 NA18489 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 4 NA18498 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 5 NA18499 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 6 NA18501 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 7 NA18502 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 8 NA18504 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n 9 NA18505 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n10 NA18507 YRI        Nigeria Africa        0       NA Modern &lt;NA&gt;  WestAfrica\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n# ℹ 17 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;, sex_set &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nGrouping is just the first step though, and doesn’t do anything on its own…\n\n\n2. summarize()\nWhy is grouping introduced above even useful? The most simple use case is computing summary statistics on the data on a “per group” basis using the summarize() function. This function works a little bit like mutate(), because it creates new columns, but it only creates one row for each group.\nFor instance, we could compute the mean coverage of each individual in a group like this, and arrange the groups by the coverage available:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, set) %&gt;%                   # first create groups\n  summarize(mean_coverage = mean(coverage)) %&gt;%  # then create summaries for each group\n  arrange(desc(mean_coverage))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   continent [4]\n   continent set     mean_coverage\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Asia      Archaic         35.3 \n 2 Europe    Archaic         24.4 \n 3 Africa    Ancient          4.99\n 4 America   Ancient          2.67\n 5 Asia      Ancient          1.71\n 6 Europe    Ancient          1.41\n 7 Africa    Modern          NA   \n 8 America   Modern          NA   \n 9 Asia      Modern          NA   \n10 Europe    Modern          NA   \n\n\nNotice that the result has only three columns, unlike the many columns in the original df table! We have a column for each variable we grouped over, and we have the new column with our summary statistic. Additionally, we only have 10 rows, one row for each combination of continent and set. So, this is kind of similar to mutate() (it creates new variables/columns), but different.\n\nWhat does the NA value for “Modern” individuals in the output of the previous code chunk? Take a look at the original data df to answer this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason is simple – the present-day individuals are high quality imputed genotypes, which is why the sequencing coverage column is full of NA (not available, i.e., missing data) values. Computing a mean of such values is, itself, an NA value too:\n\nmean(c(NA, NA, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarize() is even more powerful than that because we can compute many different things at the same time, for each group! The next exercise is an example of that.\nAs you know, the mean (such as the mean_coverage we computed right above) is computed as a sum of a set of values divided by their count. Use the group_by() and summarize() code like we used above, but instead of computing the mean() directly, compute it manually by doing (in a summarize() call):\n\nsum_coverage = sum(coverage) (the sum of coverages for each group),\nn = n() (the number of values in each group),\nmean_coverage = sum_coverage / n (using the two quantities just computed to calculate the mean)\n\nTo make things a little tidier, arrange() the results by the column mean_coverage.\nOnce you have your results, save this new table in a variable called df_summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s our entire pipeline to compute the mean coverage “manually” instead of the built-in function mean() like we did in the previous exercise:\n\ndf_summary &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%                               # take the data frame df...\n  group_by(continent, set) %&gt;%         # ... group rows on continent and set...\n  summarize(                           # ... and compute for each group:\n    sum_coverage = sum(coverage),      #       1. the sum of all coverage\n    n = n(),                           #       2. the number of coverages\n    mean_coverage = sum_coverage / n   #       3. the mean using 1. and 2.above\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(mean_coverage)               # ... then sort by average coverage\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\ndf_summary\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n# Groups:   continent [4]\n   continent set     sum_coverage     n mean_coverage\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Europe    Ancient       1722.   1220          1.41\n 2 Asia      Ancient        600.    350          1.71\n 3 America   Ancient        205.     77          2.67\n 4 Africa    Ancient         84.8    17          4.99\n 5 Europe    Archaic         24.4     1         24.4 \n 6 Asia      Archaic         70.6     2         35.3 \n 7 Africa    Modern          NA     504         NA   \n 8 America   Modern          NA     504         NA   \n 9 Asia      Modern          NA     993         NA   \n10 Europe    Modern          NA     404         NA   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the function ?ungroup. Why is it useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough grouping is very useful for computing summary statistics across groups of values, we often need to discard the grouping because we might want to continue working with the summarized table we obtained with other tidyverse functions without working on the pre-defined groups. For instance, we might want to follow up a summarize() operation with a mutate() operation, without working with groups.\n\n\n\n\nHow would you compute 95% confidence interval for the mean coverage using the group_by() and summarize()? Remember that you will need standard deviation (R function sd()) and also the number of observations (function n()). Look up confidence interval equation on Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re here this means that you needed extra challenge, so I’m sure you figured it out. :P Reach out to me if you want to discuss the solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslice_ functions\nFinally, in addition to computing various summaries on groups using summarize(), we have five “slicing” functions at our disposal, each of which extracts specific row(s) from each defined group. These functions are:\n\nslice_head(n = 1) takes the first row,\nslice_tail(n = 1) takes the last row,\nslice_min(&lt;column&gt;, n = 1) takes the row with the smallest value of ,\nslice_max(&lt;column&gt;, n = 1) takes the row with the largest value of ,\nslice_sample(&lt;col&gt; = 1) takes one random row.\n\n\nWhat is the lowest coverage individual in each group? While you’re doing this, filter() out the set of “Modern” individuals because they are not meaningful anyway (they have NA coverages), composing the entire command as a series of steps in a %&gt;% pipeline.\n*At the end of your %&gt;% pipeline, pipe your results into relocate(continent, set) to make everything even tidier..**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(set != \"Modern\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, set) %&gt;%\n  slice_min(coverage, n = 1) %&gt;%\n  relocate(continent, set)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 26\n# Groups:   continent, set [6]\n  continent set     sample       population country    age coverage site  region\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Africa    Ancient gun002       gun002     Canary…   860.   0.213  Tene… North…\n2 America   Ancient AM71         AM71       Chile     100    0.103  Stra… South…\n3 Asia      Ancient NEO916       NEO916     Russia   5727    0.0175 Veng… North…\n4 Asia      Archaic Denisova     Denisova   Russia  80000   25.8    Deni… North…\n5 Europe    Ancient NEO496       NEO496     Ukraine 10655    0.0124 Vasi… Centr…\n6 Europe    Archaic Vindija33.19 Vindija33… Croatia 41950   24.4    Vind… Centr…\n# ℹ 17 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;, sex_set &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is the oldest individual we have available on each continent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(set != \"Modern\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(age) %&gt;%\n  relocate(continent, set, age)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 26\n# Groups:   continent [4]\n  continent set        age sample       population country coverage site  region\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Africa    Ancient   7885 I10871       I10871     Camero…     15.2 Shum… Centr…\n2 America   Ancient  12649 Clovis       Clovis     USA         15.1 Mont… North…\n3 Asia      Archaic 125000 AltaiNeande… AltaiNean… Russia      44.8 Deni… North…\n4 Europe    Archaic  41950 Vindija33.19 Vindija33… Croatia     24.4 Vind… Centr…\n# ℹ 17 more variables: groupLabel &lt;chr&gt;, flag &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;, age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;, sex_desc &lt;chr&gt;, sex_set &lt;chr&gt;",

Over time, with practice, you will get there too.\nAnd this is actually just the beginning! The true power of data science arrives when we learn ggplot2 visualization later. ggplot2 uses the same philosophical principles ad the dplyr commands we practiced above, but allows you to “visualize information at the same time as you’re thinking about it”.",

We will build the components of a processing and filtering (and later visualization) pipeline for a new Identity-by-Descent (IBD) data set that I recently got my hands on. We will proceed step by step, developing new components to the processing and analytical pipeline and learning how tidyverse can be useful in a very practical way, before we learn how to wrap it all up in a nice, structured, reproducible way in later parts of our workshop.\nThis is a real world example! You will be retracing the steps I had to work through in my job in August 2025 where I got sent a completely unfamiliar new data set of IBD segments and asked to do some science with it. 😳\nWhy do this tidyverse stuff again? We just did this with the metadata table.\nA few reasons:\nAgain, here is how the start of our solutions script for this session will look like. Same as before.\nAs always, if you’re ever unsure about some function, don’t forget you can use ?function_name to get help on how it works, what are its optional arguments, and (on the bottom of the help page) see copy-pasteable examples you can try to get intuition into how that function works in practice!",

What about the other way around – do all individuals in the metadata have some IBD relationship to another individual in the IBD segments table? If not, find out which individuals are these.\nThis is another sort of sanity checking you will be doing all the time. We can only analyze data for which we have metadata information (population assignment, geographical location, dating information), so let’s make sure we have what we need.\nHint: Another way to phrase this question is this: does every name that appears in either sample1 or sample2 column of ibd_segments have a record in the sampleId column of metadata_all (i.e., is information in one vector of names a perfect subset of the second vector of names)? Remember that you can use the function unique() to get all unique values in a given vector (as in, all unique values in vector ibd$sample1 which has otherwise many duplicated entries). And remember the existence of %in% and ! operators!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can get unique values across a combination of vectors by first binding everything together using c(ibd$sample1, ibd$sample2) which gets us a single vector, then calling unique() on that:\n\nibd_samples &lt;- unique(c(ibd_segments$sample1, ibd_segments$sample2))\n\nmetadata_samples &lt;- metadata_all$sampleId\n\nThen we can use our well-known operator %in% to check that every sample in the IBD data has a representative in the metadata:\n\nall(ibd_samples %in% metadata_samples)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis is a good sign! We’re not missing any information about anyone we have an IBD segment for! Otherwise, we would have trouble analyzing such person’s IBD patterns across time, geography, populations, etc.\nHow about the other way around? Note that this is not the same operation, although it might look similar superficially:\n\nall(metadata_samples %in% ibd_samples)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe FALSE answer tells us that there are some individuals in our metadata who are not participating in any pairwise IBD sharing. Who are these?\n\nmetadata_all[!metadata_samples %in% ibd_samples, ]\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 24\n  sampleId popId    site      country region continent groupLabel groupAge flag \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NEO962   NEO962   Dragsholm Denmark North… Europe    Denmark_M… Ancient  0    \n2 Denisova Denisova Denisova… Russia  North… Asia      Denisova_… Archaic  0    \n# ℹ 15 more variables: latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, dataSource &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age14C &lt;dbl&gt;, ageHigh &lt;dbl&gt;, ageLow &lt;dbl&gt;, ageAverage &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   datingSource &lt;chr&gt;, coverage &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, hgMT &lt;chr&gt;, gpAvg &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ageRaw &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMajor &lt;chr&gt;, hgYMinor &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the basic sanity check above, we can be sure that our IBD segments table can be co-analyzed with the information in the metadata and that we won’t be missing anything important.",

Then rename() sampleId to sample, popId to pop, and ageAverage to age just to save ourselves some typing later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata &lt;- select(metadata_all, sample = sampleId, country, continent, age = ageAverage)\n\nmetadata\n\n# A tibble: 4,072 × 4\n   sample  country continent   age\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 NA18486 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 2 NA18488 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 3 NA18489 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 4 NA18498 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 5 NA18499 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 6 NA18501 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 7 NA18502 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 8 NA18504 Nigeria Africa       NA\n 9 NA18505 Nigeria Africa       NA\n10 NA18507 Nigeria Africa       NA\n# ℹ 4,062 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as you did in the previous chapter, use mutate() and if_else() inside the mutate() call to make sure that the “modern” individuals have the age set to 0, instead of NA (and everyone else’s age stays the same). In other words, for rows where age is NA, replace that NA with 0. Yes, you did this before, but try not to copy-paste your solution. Try doing this on your own first.\nHint: Remember the is.na() bit we used before! Try it on the age column vector if you need a reminder: is.na(metadata$age).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata &lt;- mutate(metadata, age = if_else(is.na(age), 0, age))\n\nLet’s make sure we haven’t missed anything else:\n\nall(!is.na(metadata$age))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur analyses will exclusively focus on modern humans. Filter out the three archaics in the metadata, saving the results into the same metadata variable again. As a reminder, these are individuals whose sample name is among c(\"Vindija33.19\", \"AltaiNeandertal\", \"Denisova\") which you can test in a filter() command using the %in% operator.\nHint: Remember that you can get a TRUE / FALSE indexing vector (remember our R bootcamp session!) by not only column %in% c(... some values...) but you can also do the opposite test as !column %in% c(... some values...) (notice the ! operator in the second bit of code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata &lt;- filter(metadata, !sample %in% c(\"Vindija33.19\", \"AltaiNeandertal\", \"Denisova\"))",

For instance, later we might want to do some fancier analyses, looking at IBD as a time series, not just across basically two temporal categories, “young” and “old”.\nTo this end, let’s create more useful time-bin categories! This will require a bit more code than above solutions. Don’t feel overwhelmed! I will first introduce a useful function using a couple of examples for you to play around with in your R console. Only then we will move on to an exercise in which you will try to implement this on the full metadata table! For now, keep on reading and experimenting in your R console!\nIt will be worth it, because this kind of binning is something we do all the time in computational biology, in every project.\n\nLet’s introduce an incredibly useful function called cut(). Take a look at ?cut help page and skim through it to figure out what it does. As a bit of a hint, we will want to add a new metadata column which will indicate in which age bin (maybe, split in steps of 5000 years) do our individuals belong to.\nHere’s a small example to help us get started. Imagine that df is a example representative of our full-blown metadata table. Copy this into your script, so that you can experiment with the cut() technique in this section.\n\n# a toy example data frame mimicking the age column in our huge metadata table\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  sample = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"q\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"t\"),\n  age = c(0, 0, 1000, 0, 5000, 10000, 7000, 13000, 18000, 21000, 27000, 30000)\n)\ndf\n\n   sample   age\n1       a     0\n2       b     0\n3       c  1000\n4       d     0\n5       x  5000\n6       y 10000\n7       z  7000\n8       q 13000\n9       w 18000\n10      e 21000\n11      r 27000\n12      t 30000\n\n\nThink about what the cut() function does here based on the result it gives you on the little example code below. You can pretend for now that the ages variable corresponds to age of our samples in the huge metadata table. Again, try running this on your own to see what happens when you run this code in your R console. Particularly, take a look at the format of the new column age_bin:\n\n# let's first generate the breakpoints for our bins (check out `?seq` if\n# you're confused by this!)\nbreakpoints &lt;- seq(0, 50000, by = 5000)\nbreakpoints\n##  [1]     0  5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 40000 45000 50000\n\n# binning the age into groups using our breakpoints\ndf$age_bin &lt;- cut(df$age, breaks = breakpoints)\n\ndf\n##    sample   age         age_bin\n## 1       a     0            &lt;NA&gt;\n## 2       b     0            &lt;NA&gt;\n## 3       c  1000       (0,5e+03]\n## 4       d     0            &lt;NA&gt;\n## 5       x  5000       (0,5e+03]\n## 6       y 10000   (5e+03,1e+04]\n## 7       z  7000   (5e+03,1e+04]\n## 8       q 13000 (1e+04,1.5e+04]\n## 9       w 18000 (1.5e+04,2e+04]\n## 10      e 21000 (2e+04,2.5e+04]\n## 11      r 27000 (2.5e+04,3e+04]\n## 12      t 30000 (2.5e+04,3e+04]\n\nNote: The function cut() is extremely useful whenever you want to discretize some continuous variable in bins (basically, a little similar to what a histogram does in context of plotting). Doing statistics on this kind of binned data is something we do very often. So never forget that cut() is there to help you! For example, you could also use the same concept to partition samples into categories based on “low coverage”, “medium coverage”, “high coverage”, etc.\n\nIn the example of the cut() function right above, what is the data type of the column age_bin created by the cut() function? Use glimpse(df) to see this data type, then skim through the documentation of ?factor. What is a “factor” according to this documentation?\nNote: This is a challenging topic. Please don’t stress. When we’re done I’ll walk through everything myself, interactively, and will explain things in detail. Take this information on “factors” as something to be aware of and a concept to be introduced to, but not something to necessarily be an expert on!\n\nHaving learned about ?factor above, consider the two following vectors and use them for experimentation when coming up with answers. What do you see when you print them out in your R console (by typing x1 and x2)? And what happens when you apply the typeof() function on both of them? x2 gives you a strange result — why? What do you get when you run the following command levels(x2)? What do you get when you run as.character(x2)?\n\nx1 &lt;- c(\"hello\", \"hello\", \"these\", \"are\", \"characters/strings\")\nx2 &lt;- factor(x1)\n\nIn applying cut() to the toy data frame df, why is the age_bin value equal to NA for some of the rows?\nNote: The discussion of “factors” should’ve been technically part of our R bootcamp chapter, on the topic of “data types”. However, that section was already too technical, so I decided to move it here to the data analysis section, because I think it makes more sense to explain it in a wider context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that both vectors look the same, but the second has additional information about “levels”:\n\nx1\n\n[1] \"hello\"              \"hello\"              \"these\"             \n[4] \"are\"                \"characters/strings\"\n\nx2\n\n[1] hello              hello              these              are               \n[5] characters/strings\nLevels: are characters/strings hello these\n\n\nThe reason you get the typeof(x1) as “character” but typeof(x2) as “integer” although both are “basically strings” is because factors are a special data type for encoding categorical variables which can only have a set of fixed possible values. Internally, for efficiency, levels of a factor variables are stored as integers, and their values or just “labels” for those integers.\nImportantly, factor levels are actually ordered, which is very useful for plotting, as we will see later, because the plots maintain order of factors when visualized.\nFor now, don’t worry about this too much. We needed to introduce the concept of factors because they are very frequently used whenever we need to bin continuous data, like we will now for assigning samples into bins based on their age value.\n\nOh, and the answer to why cut() gave us the NA for every 0 value is because of its include.lowest argument is set to FALSE. Compare these two:\n\ncut(df$age, breaks = seq(0, 50000, by = 10000))\n\n [1] &lt;NA&gt;          &lt;NA&gt;          (0,1e+04]     &lt;NA&gt;          (0,1e+04]    \n [6] (0,1e+04]     (0,1e+04]     (1e+04,2e+04] (1e+04,2e+04] (2e+04,3e+04]\n[11] (2e+04,3e+04] (2e+04,3e+04]\n5 Levels: (0,1e+04] (1e+04,2e+04] (2e+04,3e+04] ... (4e+04,5e+04]\n\n\n\ncut(df$age, breaks = seq(0, 50000, by = 10000), include.lowest = TRUE)\n\n [1] [0,1e+04]     [0,1e+04]     [0,1e+04]     [0,1e+04]     [0,1e+04]    \n [6] [0,1e+04]     [0,1e+04]     (1e+04,2e+04] (1e+04,2e+04] (2e+04,3e+04]\n[11] (2e+04,3e+04] (2e+04,3e+04]\n5 Levels: [0,1e+04] (1e+04,2e+04] (2e+04,3e+04] ... (4e+04,5e+04]\n\n\nHowever, this isn’t what we want, because we want to treat present-day individuals separately as their own category, not include them with other ancient people less than 5000 years old.\nThe levels() function is useful for getting the “labels” of the categories as they are presented to you in various outputs (rather than their internal numerical encoding).\nConsider the original vector x2 (note the duplicated “hello” value):\n\nx2\n\n[1] hello              hello              these              are               \n[5] characters/strings\nLevels: are characters/strings hello these\n\n\nAnd the levels() output:\n\nlevels(x2)\n\n[1] \"are\"                \"characters/strings\" \"hello\"             \n[4] \"these\"             \n\n\nWhen we run as.character(), we effectively convert the (categorical) factor values into normal strings (i.e., basically convert those values into their plain labels). This is very useful whenever we want to manipulate factors, as we’ll se below:\n\nas.character(x2)\n\n[1] \"hello\"              \"hello\"              \"these\"             \n[4] \"are\"                \"characters/strings\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scientific notation format of bin labels with 5+e3 etc. is very annoying to look at. How can you use the dig.lab = argument of the cut() functions to make this prettier? Experiment in the R console to figure this out, then modify the df$age_bin &lt;- cut(df$age, breaks = breakpoints) command in your script accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s experiment first:\n\n# this is where we started\ncut(df$age, breaks = breakpoints)\n\n [1] &lt;NA&gt;            &lt;NA&gt;            (0,5e+03]       &lt;NA&gt;           \n [5] (0,5e+03]       (5e+03,1e+04]   (5e+03,1e+04]   (1e+04,1.5e+04]\n [9] (1.5e+04,2e+04] (2e+04,2.5e+04] (2.5e+04,3e+04] (2.5e+04,3e+04]\n10 Levels: (0,5e+03] (5e+03,1e+04] (1e+04,1.5e+04] ...

(45000,50000]\n\n\nOur solution to get rid of the ugly scientific notation in our labels is therefore:\n\ndf$age_bin &lt;- cut(df$age, breaks = breakpoints, dig.lab = 10)\n\ndf\n\n   sample   age       age_bin\n1       a     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n2       b     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n3       c  1000      (0,5000]\n4       d     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n5       x  5000      (0,5000]\n6       y 10000  (5000,10000]\n7       z  7000  (5000,10000]\n8       q 13000 (10000,15000]\n9       w 18000 (15000,20000]\n10      e 21000 (20000,25000]\n11      r 27000 (25000,30000]\n12      t 30000 (25000,30000]\n\n\nMuch nicer to look at and immediately readable!\n\n\n\n\nYou have now learned that cut() has an optional argument called include.lowest =, which includes the lowest value of 0 (representing the “present-day” age of our samples) in the lowest bin [0, 5]. However, in the case of our assignment of samples from present-day, this is not what we want. We want present-day individuals to have their own category called “present-day”.\nHere’s a useful bit of code I use often for this exact purpose, represented as a complete self-contained chunk of the time-binning code. If we start from the original toy example data frame (with the NA values assigned to present-day ages of 0):\n\ndf\n\n   sample   age       age_bin\n1       a     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n2       b     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n3       c  1000      (0,5000]\n4       d     0          &lt;NA&gt;\n5       x  5000      (0,5000]\n6       y 10000  (5000,10000]\n7       z  7000  (5000,10000]\n8       q 13000 (10000,15000]\n9       w 18000 (15000,20000]\n10      e 21000 (20000,25000]\n11      r 27000 (25000,30000]\n12      t 30000 (25000,30000]\n\n\nWe can fix this by the following three-step process, described in the comments. Don’t stress about any of this! Just run this code on your own and try to relate the # text description of each step in comments to the code itself. Every thing that’s being done here are bits and pieces introduced above.\n\n# 0. assign each row to a bin based on given breakpoints\ndf$age_bin &lt;- cut(df$age, breaks = breakpoints, dig.lab = 10)\n\n# 1. extract labels (no \"present-day\" category yet)\nbin_levels &lt;- levels(df$age_bin)\n\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    age_bin = as.character(age_bin),  # 2. convert factors back to \"plain strings\"\n    age_bin = if_else(is.na(age_bin), \"present-day\", age_bin), # 3. replace NA with \"present-day\",\n    age_bin = factor(age_bin, levels = c(\"present-day\", bin_levels)) # 4. convert to factor (to maintain order of levels)\n  )\n\nPlease run the code above bit by bit, inspecting the variables you create (or modify) after each step. Remember the CTRL / CMD + Enter shortcut for stepping through code!\nWhen we print the modified df table, we see all bins properly assigned now, including the present-day samples with ages at 0:\n\ndf\n\n   sample   age       age_bin\n1       a     0   present-day\n2       b     0   present-day\n3       c  1000      (0,5000]\n4       d     0   present-day\n5       x  5000      (0,5000]\n6       y 10000  (5000,10000]\n7       z  7000  (5000,10000]\n8       q 13000 (10000,15000]\n9       w 18000 (15000,20000]\n10      e 21000 (20000,25000]\n11      r 27000 (25000,30000]\n12      t 30000 (25000,30000]\n\n\nThis is a very useful pattern which you will get to practice now on the full metadata table, by literally applying the same code on the big table.\n\nNow that you’re familiar with the cut() technique for binning values, use the functions mutate() and cut() again (in exactly the same way as we did on the df table in the code chunk above!) to create a new column age_bin this time on the whole metadata table. The new column should carry a category age of each individual in steps of 10000 years again.\nHint: As we did above, first assign the age_bin column using the cut() function, then modify the column accordingly with the mutate() snippet to set “present-day” in the age_bin for all present-day individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can match the step numbers to our example code applied on the smaller table df above. They do the same thing!\n\n# step 0. we first bin samples according to their age\nbin_step &lt;- 10000\nmetadata$age_bin &lt;- cut(metadata$age, breaks = seq(0, 50000, by = bin_step), dig.lab = 10)\n\n# step 1. get the assigned bin labels\nbin_levels &lt;- levels(metadata$age_bin)\n\n# then we modify the bins to include \"present-day\" labels:\nmetadata &lt;- metadata %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    age_bin = as.character(age_bin), # step 2.\n    age_bin = if_else(is.na(age_bin), \"present-day\", age_bin), # step 3.\n    age_bin = factor(age_bin, levels = c(\"present-day\", bin_levels)) # step 4.\n  )\n\nWe can check the binning result to see that we’ve been successful!\n\ntable(metadata$age_bin)\n\n\n  present-day     (0,10000] (10000,20000] (20000,30000] (30000,40000] \n         2405          1623            31             2             7 \n(40000,50000] \n            1 \n\n\nThe reason we converted the age_bin back to factor in the end is that we want to maintain a temporal order of our labels (first “present-day”, then all other subsequent time bins), regardless of how mixed our rows are.\n\n\n\n\nHow many individuals did we end up with in each age_bin? Use table() to answer this question (and also to sanity check your final results), to make sure everything worked correctly.",

    "text": "Recipe for merging metadata\nAfter basic processing and filtering of the primary data (in our case, the genomic coordinates of pairwise IBD segments), we often need to annotate this data with some meta information… which is what we already processed too! What does this mean? Take a look at our IBD data in its current state again:\n\nhead(ibd_segments)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  sample1 sample2 chrom start   end rel   length\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 VK548   NA20502    21  58.3  62.1 none   3.75 \n2 VK528   HG01527    21  24.8  27.9 none   3.04 \n3 PL_N28  NEO36      21  14.0  16.5 none   2.44 \n4 NEO556  HG02230    21  13.1  14.0 none   0.962\n5 HG02399 HG04062    21  18.8  21.0 none   2.21 \n6 EKA1    NEO220     21  30.1  35.8 none   5.72 \n\n\nWhen we analyze things down the line, we might want to look at IBD patterns over space and time, look at some temporal changes, etc. However, our IBD data has none of the information in it! Besides names of individuals (from which population, at which time, which geographical location?) we have nothing, so even if we were to do run our friends group_by() and summarize() to get some summary statistics to get some insights into the history or biological relationships between our samples, we have no idea to correlate them to other variables… precisely because those variables are elsewhere in a completely different table we called metadata.\nWe now need to put both sources of information into a single joint format. I call this “metadata merging”, and it is something we always want to do regardless of what kinds of statistics or measures we work with.\nThe technique below is again a very useful recipe for your future work.\nAgain, the annotation that we need is in the metadata table — it has information about ages and geography:\n\nhead(metadata)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  sample  country continent   age age_bin    \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;      \n1 NA18486 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n2 NA18488 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n3 NA18489 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n4 NA18498 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n5 NA18499 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n6 NA18501 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n\n\nWhat we need to do is join our IBD data with a selection of the most important variables in our metadata, which is what we’re going to do now.\nThis bit might be a bit frustrating and repetitive if I made this into an exercise for you, so just inspect the following code, run it yourself (and put it into your own script) and try to make sense of it. Take this as a recipe that you can modify and reuse in your own projects later!\nI’m happy to answer questions!\n\nStep 1.\nFor each IBD segment (a row in our table ibd_segments) we have two individuals on each row, sample1 and sample2. Therefore, we will need to annotate each row of the ibd_segments table with metadata information for both individuals. Let’s start by making a copy of the metadata table, caling those copies metadata1 and metadata2:\n\nmetadata1 &lt;- metadata\nmetadata2 &lt;- metadata\n\n\n\nStep 2.\nThe columns of these metadata copies are the same, which you can verify by running this:\n\ncolnames(metadata1)\n## [1] \"sample\"    \"country\"   \"continent\" \"age\"       \"age_bin\"\nhead(metadata1, 1)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 5\n##   sample  country continent   age age_bin    \n##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;      \n## 1 NA18486 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n\n\ncolnames(metadata2)\n## [1] \"sample\"    \"country\"   \"continent\" \"age\"       \"age_bin\"\nhead(metadata2, 1)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 5\n##   sample  country continent   age age_bin    \n##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;      \n## 1 NA18486 Nigeria Africa        0 present-day\n\nObviously this doesn’t work if we want to refer to a location of sample1 or sample2, respectively. Here’s another useful trick for this. Observe what paste0() function does in this situation:\n\n# original columns\ncolnames(metadata1)\n\n[1] \"sample\"    \"country\"   \"continent\" \"age\"       \"age_bin\"  \n\n# columns with a number added after\npaste0(colnames(metadata1), \"1\")\n\n[1] \"sample1\"    \"country1\"   \"continent1\" \"age1\"       \"age_bin1\"  \n\n\nSo using paste0() we can append “1” or “2” to each column name of both tables. We can use the same approach to assign new columns to each of our metadata copies:\n\ncolnames(metadata1) &lt;- paste0(colnames(metadata1), \"1\")\ncolnames(metadata2) &lt;- paste0(colnames(metadata2), \"2\")\n\nNow we have both metadata tables with columns renamed. Let’s check this to make sure we did this correctly:\n\ncolnames(metadata1)\n\n[1] \"sample1\"    \"country1\"   \"continent1\" \"age1\"       \"age_bin1\"  \n\ncolnames(metadata2)\n\n[1] \"sample2\"    \"country2\"   \"continent2\" \"age2\"       \"age_bin2\"  \n\n\n\n\nStep 3.\nNow we are ready to join the table of IBD segments.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is a JOIN operation from the realm of computer databases. A rather complex topic, which can be interpreted very easily in our situation, and can be schematically described by the following diagram of a so-called “inner join”, implemented in dplyr by a function inner_join():\nNote: If you’re more familiar with tidyverse from before, I still think joins might be a relatively new topic. If so, please take a bit of time to read the dplyr documentation on this topic. Joins are a superpower of data science.\n:::  :::\nWhat this operation does is that it creates a “merged” table, consisting of the columns of both “left” and “right” tables, where the “merged” table rows consist of such rows from “left” and “right”, where the two tables have a matching “key” column (here highlighted in green). Just take a moment and try to trace the one row of the “merged” table at the bottom of the diagram to the row(s) of the “left” and “right” tables based on the value of the green key column in both of them.\nNow, consider the columns of our three tables now:\n\nibd_segments columns:\n\n\n\n[1] \"sample1\" \"sample2\" \"chrom\"   \"start\"   \"end\"     \"rel\"     \"length\" \n\n\n\nmetadata1 and metadata2 columns:\n\n\n\n[1] \"sample1\"    \"country1\"   \"continent1\" \"age1\"       \"age_bin1\"  \n\n\n\n\n[1] \"sample2\"    \"country2\"   \"continent2\" \"age2\"       \"age_bin2\"  \n\n\nHere’s what happens when you perform an inner join like this (note that we specify by what column should we be merging, effectively saying which column is the key corresponding to the green column in the diagram above):\n\nibd_merged &lt;- inner_join(ibd_segments, metadata1, by = \"sample1\")\n\nTake a look at the results, saved in a new variable ibd_merged, by typing it into your R console. Our IBD table now has added metadata information for individuals in column sample1, awesome! We can verify this by listing all column names:\n\n# original IBD table:\ncolnames(ibd_segments)\n\n[1] \"sample1\" \"sample2\" \"chrom\"   \"start\"   \"end\"     \"rel\"     \"length\" \n\n# IBD table with metadata1 merged in:\ncolnames(ibd_merged)\n\n [1] \"sample1\"    \"sample2\"    \"chrom\"      \"start\"      \"end\"       \n [6] \"rel\"        \"length\"     \"country1\"   \"continent1\" \"age1\"      \n[11] \"age_bin1\"  \n\n\nHow do we add metadata for the second sample? We do it in the same way, except now we join in the second table (and we save the results back to the new variable ibd_merged, to be able to compare the differences):\n\nibd_merged &lt;- inner_join(ibd_merged, metadata2, by = \"sample2\")\n\nIn fact, I do this so often for basically every computational biology project, that I like to use this concise bit of code to do it all in one go (this is what you should add to your script!):\n\nibd_merged &lt;-\n  ibd_segments %&gt;%                          # 1. primary data without metadata\n  inner_join(metadata1, by = \"sample1\") %&gt;% # 2. add metadata for sample1\n  inner_join(metadata2, by = \"sample2\")     # 3. add metadata for sample2\n\nAgain, we can verify that our new table has metadata columns for both sample1 and sample2:\n\ncolnames(ibd_segments)\n\n[1] \"sample1\" \"sample2\" \"chrom\"   \"start\"   \"end\"     \"rel\"     \"length\" \n\ncolnames(ibd_merged)\n\n [1] \"sample1\"    \"sample2\"    \"chrom\"      \"start\"      \"end\"       \n [6] \"rel\"        \"length\"     \"country1\"   \"continent1\" \"age1\"      \n[11] \"age_bin1\"   \"country2\"   \"continent2\" \"age2\"       \"age_bin2\"  \n\n\n\nAnd this concludes merging of the primary IBD data with all necessary meta information! Every computational project I do has something like this somewhere. Of course, in the case of your primary data which could be observations at particular ecological sampling sites or excavation sites, etc., this annotation might involve metadata with more specific geographical information, environmental data, etc.",

    "text": "Exercise 4. Final data processing\nYou’ve already seen the super useful function paste() (and also paste0()) which useful whenever we need to join the elements of two (or more) character vectors together. The difference between then is that paste0() doesn’t add a space between the individual values and paste() does (the latter also allows you to customize the string which should be used for joining instead of the space).\nTake a look at your almost finalized table ibd_merged:\n\nhead(ibd_merged)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n  sample1 sample2 chrom start   end rel   length country1 continent1  age1\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 VK548   NA20502    21  58.3  62.1 none   3.75  Norway   Europe     1000 \n2 VK528   HG01527    21  24.8  27.9 none   3.04  Norway   Europe     1050 \n3 PL_N28  NEO36      21  14.0  16.5 none   2.44  Poland   Europe     6074.\n4 NEO556  HG02230    21  13.1  14.0 none   0.962 Russia   Europe     7030 \n5 HG02399 HG04062    21  18.8  21.0 none   2.21  China    Asia          0 \n6 EKA1    NEO220     21  30.1  35.8 none   5.72  Estonia  Europe     4240 \n# ℹ 5 more variables: age_bin1 &lt;fct&gt;, country2 &lt;chr&gt;, continent2 &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age2 &lt;dbl&gt;, age_bin2 &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\nWhen we get to comparing IBD patterns between countries, time bins, etc., it might be useful to have metadata columns specific for that purpose. What do I mean by this? For instance, consider these two vectors and the result of pasting them together. Having this combined pair information makes it very easy to cross-compare multiple sample categories together, rather than having to keep track of two variables v1 or v2, we have just the merged pairs:\n\nv1 &lt;- c(\"Denmark\", \"Czech Republic\", \"Estonia\")\nv2 &lt;- c(\"Finland\", \"Italy\", \"Estonia\")\n\npairs_v &lt;- paste(v1, v2, sep = \":\")\npairs_v\n\n[1] \"Denmark:Finland\"      \"Czech Republic:Italy\" \"Estonia:Estonia\"     \n\n\n\nLet’s create this information for country1/2, continent1/2, and age_bin1/2 columns.\nSpecifically, use the same paste() trick in a mutate() function to add a new column to your ibd_merged table named country_pair, which will contain a vector of values created by joining of the columns country1 and country2. Add this column .before the chrom column for clearer visibility (check out ?mutate if you need a refresher on how does its .before = argument work). Then do the same to create a region_pair based on continent1 and continent2. Save the result back to the variable named ibd_merged.\nHint: Note that you can create multiple new columns with mutate(), but you can also pipe %&gt;% one mutate() into another mutate() into another mutate(), etc.!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_merged &lt;- mutate(\n  ibd_merged,\n  country_pair = paste(country1, country2, sep = \":\"),\n  region_pair = paste(continent1, continent2, sep = \":\"),\n  .before = chrom\n)\n\n# let's verify the results\nibd_merged\n\n# A tibble: 461,847 × 17\n   sample1 sample2 country_pair     region_pair   chrom start   end rel   length\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 VK548   NA20502 Norway:Italy     Europe:Europe    21  58.3  62.1 none   3.75 \n 2 VK528   HG01527 Norway:Spain     Europe:Europe    21  24.8  27.9 none   3.04 \n 3 PL_N28  NEO36   Poland:Sweden    Europe:Europe    21  14.0  16.5 none   2.44 \n 4 NEO556  HG02230 Russia:Spain     Europe:Europe    21  13.1  14.0 none   0.962\n 5 HG02399 HG04062 China:India      Asia:Asia        21  18.8  21.0 none   2.21 \n 6 EKA1    NEO220  Estonia:Sweden   Europe:Europe    21  30.1  35.8 none   5.72 \n 7 19651   HG01941 Canada:Peru      America:Amer…    21  49.0  51.3 none   2.24 \n 8 HG02181 HG04033 China:India      Asia:Asia        21  13.1  13.9 none   0.868\n 9 VK328   HG01438 Denmark:Colombia Europe:Ameri…    21  60.7  62.8 none   2.04 \n10 F004    HG03616 China:India      Asia:Asia        21  25.4  27.6 none   2.15 \n# ℹ 461,837 more rows\n# ℹ 8 more variables: country1 &lt;chr&gt;, continent1 &lt;chr&gt;, age1 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   age_bin1 &lt;fct&gt;, country2 &lt;chr&gt;, continent2 &lt;chr&gt;, age2 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   age_bin2 &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to computing statistics across pairs of geographical regions, we will also probably want to look at temporal patterns.

    "text": "Exercise 5: Reproducibility intermezzo\nYou have written a lot of code in this chapter, both for filtering and processing of the IBD data and the metadata. Your script is already very long. If you need to ever update or change something (which you always will during a project, usually many times over) it can be hard to figure out which line of your script should be modified. If you forget to update something somewhere in a long script, you’re in big trouble (and sometimes you won’t even find out where’s the problem until its too late).\nOur session on reproducibility is in the following chapter, and will introduce various techniques towards making a project codebase tidyly structured and reproducible. But for now, let’s work towards making our current IBD pipeline a little bit more reusable (which we will leverage in the next session on ggplot2).\n\nCreate a new script called ibd_utils.R in your RStudio and create the following functions. Then take bits and pieces from the exercises used above and add them to the bodies of these functions accordingly, so that each function contains all the code we used above for that particular step.\nNote: If you’ve never written R functions before and are confused, don’t worry. You can skip ahead and use my solution! If you do, however, try to examine the code in each of the three functions, and try to make a connection between it — line by line — and the code you ran earlier in our session!\n\nFirst, don’t forget to load all packages needed using library() calls at the top of the ibd_utils.R script.\nCreate a function process_ibd &lt;- function() { ... add all code here ... } which will:\n\n\nread the IBD data from the internet like you did above using read_tsv()\nprocess it in the same way you did above, adding the length column\nreturn the processed table with IBD segments in the same way like you produced the ibd_segments data frame with return(ibd_segments) at the last line of that function\n\n\nfunction process_metadata &lt;- function(bin_step), which will (accepting a single bin_step argument):\n\n\ndownload the metadata from the internet like you did above,\nprocess and filter it in the same way like above (replacing NA in age column, filtering out unwanted individuals, adding the age_bin column by binning according to the bin_step function parameter, etc.)\nreturn the processed table with this processed metadata in the same way like you produced the metadata data frame as return(metadata)\n\n\nfunction join_metadata &lt;- function(ibd_segments, metdata), which will accept two arguments ibd_segments and metadata (produced by the two functions above) and then:\n\n\njoin the ibd_segments table with the metadata table\nadd the three country_pair, region_pair, and time_pair columns\nreturn the finalized table with all information, just like you created your ibd_merged table above, as return(ibd_merged)\n\nDo not write all the code at once! Start with the first function, test it by executing it in your R console independently, checking that your results make sense before you move on to the other function! Building up more complex pipelines from simple components is absolutely critical to minimize bugs!\nMake sure to add comments to your code! Reproducibility is only half of the story – you (and other people) need to be able to understand your code a long time after you wrote it.\nHint: If this looks overwhelming and scary, then remember that function is a block of code (optionally accepting arguments) which simply wraps in { and } the code already written by you above, and calls return on the result.\nHint: An extremely useful shortcut when writing R functions is “Run function definition” under Code -&gt; Run region. Remember that keyboard shortcut! (On macOS it’s Option+CMD+F).\nTo summarize, basically fill in the following template:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the “template” for ibd_utils.R\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nprocess_ibd &lt;- function() {\n  cat(\"Downloading and processing IBD data...\\n\")\n\n  # ADD ALL YOUR CODE HERE\n\n  return(ibd)\n}\n\nprocess_metadata &lt;- function(bin_step) {\n  cat(\"Downloading and processing metadata...\\n\")\n\n  # ADD ALL YOUR CODE HERE\n\n  return(metadata)\n}\n\njoin_metadata &lt;- function(ibd_segments, metadata) {\n  cat(\"Joining IBD data and metadata...\\n\")\n\n  # ADD ALL YOUR CODE HERE\n\n  return(ibd_merged)\n}\n\n\n\n\nAfter you’re done with the previous exercise, and are confident that your functions do what they should, create a new script (you can name it something like ibd_pipeline.R), save it to the same directory as your script ibd_utils.R, and add the following code to it, which, when you run it, will execute your entire pipeline and create the final ibd_merged table in a fully automated way. As a final test, restart your R session (Session -&gt; Restart R) and run the script ibd_pipeline.R.\nNote: The source() command executes all the code in your utility script and therefore makes your custom-built functions available in your R session. This is an incredibly useful trick which you should use all the time whenever you modularize your code into reproducible functions in their own scripts.\n\n# you might need to change the path if your ibd_utils.R is in a different location\nsource(\"ibd_utils.R\")\n\nmetadata &lt;- process_metadata()\nibd_segments &lt;- process_ibd(bin_step = 10000)\n\nibd_merged &lt;- join_metadata(ibd_segments, metadata)\n\n\n\nDownloading and processing metadata...\n\n\nDownloading and processing IBD data...\n\n\nJoining IBD data and metadata...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find my solution here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You’ve just passed an important milestone of learning how to structure and modularize your code in a reproducible, efficient way!\n\n\nThis is not a joke and I really, really mean it. Most scientists sadly never reach this point in their careers, ever. Over the next sessions you will see how much difference does (admittedly very annoying!) setup makes, and even learn other techniques how to make your computational research more robust and reliable.\nIt’s worth pausing here and reflecting on what we’ve just done. Yes, we took (lots!) of code already written and basically “just moved it elsewhere”. But consider how clean your new script ibd_pipeline.R is and how easily readable it is. What we’ve done is sometimes called “abstraction” in software engineering. We took components of our pipeline, and “hidden” them away so that we no longer have to think in terms of select(), filter(), group_by(), etc. We now can think about steps called process_ibd(), process_metadata(), and join_metadata(). Much less code to look at and think about! Plus, if we do need to take a deep dive into details, we just have to look at the code of our functions!\n\nPoint your cursor somewhere inside the process_ibd() call in your new script ibd_pipeline.R and press “CTRL+.”. This is how easy it is to navigate code, even when we modularized it across multiple files!",

    "text": "Part 1: Visualizing patterns in our IBD data\nFirst, let’s start from a clean slate, and leverage our modularized pipeline we created for our IBD data. Create a new R script in RStudio (File -&gt; New file -&gt; R Script), and save it somewhere on your computer as tidy-viz.R (File -&gt; Save). Copy the following bit of code which will execute your IBD and metadata processing pipeline.\nThe following exercises will focus on basics of visualization of various types of statistical summaries, using your IBD data set as a representative of typical data we deal with when doing data science.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2) # the star of the day!\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# source our utility functions so that we have them available\nsource(\"ibd_utils.R\")\n\n# download and process the metadata and IBD data set\nmetadata &lt;- process_metadata(bin_step = 10000)\nibd_segments &lt;- process_ibd()\n\n# combine the IBD table with metadata information\nibd_merged &lt;- join_metadata(ibd_segments, metadata)\n\n\nExercise 0: Concept of layers\nAn important, powerful, and even elegant concept with building visualizations using ggplot2 is the idea of layering. Let’s start to introduce this from the simplest possible kind of visualization, which is plotting the counts of observations of a categorical (i.e. discrete) variable.\nFirst, what happens when you call a function ggplot() on its own? How about when you call ggplot(metadata), i.e. when we say we want to be plotting something from out metadata table?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get an empty “canvas”! Almost as if we were artist starting to paint something.\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaying that we want to plot metadata doesn’t change anything. We get the same empty canvas, with ggplot2 basically “waiting” for us to give it more instructions.\n\nggplot(metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in my solution, calling ggplot() on its own basically only sets up an empty “canvas”, as if we were about to start painting something.\nThis might sound like a silly metaphor, but when it comes to ggplot2 plotting, this is actually remarkably accurate. This is exactly because of the layering aspect of ggplot2.\nThere are two important components of every ggplot2 figure:\n\n1. “Aesthetics”\nAesthetics are a specification of the mapping of variables of a data frame (i.e., columns) to some kind of visual property of a plot (x, or y axis, color, shape, etc.). We specify these aesthetics with a function called aes() which you will see later many times.\n\n\n2. “Geoms”\nGeoms are graphical elements to be plotted (histograms, points, lines, etc.). We specify those using functions such as geom_bar(), geom_histogram(), geom_point(), etc., all of which you will practice now.\n\n\nHow do “aesthetics” and “geoms” fit together?\nI like to think about it this way:\n\n“geoms” specify what our data should be plotted as\n“aesthetics” specify how those geoms should look like\n\nThis is all very abstract, but don’t worry. Refer to this as a guideline when you’re implementing the exercises in practice!\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Distribution of a categorical variable\nLet’s start very simply, and introduce the layering aspect of ggplot2 visualization package step by step. Our data frame has a column age_bin, which contains the assignment of each individual into a respective time period. Let’s start by visualizing the count of individuals in each time bin.\nRun the following code in your R console. It specifies the aesthetic mapping which will map our first variable of interest (column age_bin in our data frame) to the x-axis of our eventual figure. What do you get when you run it? How is the result different from just calling ggplot(metadata) without anything else, like you did above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take it step by step:\n\nplotting command only sets up canvas\n\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsaying what data set we want to plot doesn’t change anything (ggplot2 doesn’t know what to plot yet!):\n\n\nggplot(metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmapping an aesthetic still doesn’t do anything, because we didn’t instruct ggplot2 to plot anything even now:\n\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-ha! We see a difference! ggplot2 now mapped the x axis against values of the age_bin variable. Let’s verify this by looking at all possible values of that variable:\n\ntable(metadata$age_bin)\n\n\n  present-day     (0,10000] (10000,20000] (20000,30000] (30000,40000] \n         2405          1623            31             2             7 \n(40000,50000] \n            1 \n\n\nBut even then, the plot still actually doesn’t show anything! Remember, we only instruct ggplot2 to map a variable age_bin to an x-axis of a figure… but we didn’t say what we want to visualize (i.e. a “geom”).\nTo make a visualization, both aesthetic mapping and some kind of geom is needed! We will do this in the next step.\n\n\n\n\ngeom_bar()\nYou instructed ggplot() to work with the metadata table, you mapped a variable of interest age_bin to the x-axis (and therefore set up a “mapping aesthetic”). To make a complete figure, we need to add a layer with a “geom”! In ggplot, we add layers with the + operator, mimicking the “painter metaphor” of adding layers one by one, composing a more complex figure with each additional layer.\nAdd + geom_bar() to you plotting command from the previous exercise. What happens then? How do you read the results? Compare then to what you get by running `table(metadata$age_bin).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a full figure, yay!\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot matches the counts in our data indeed:\n\ntable(metadata$age_bin)\n\n\n  present-day     (0,10000] (10000,20000] (20000,30000] (30000,40000] \n         2405          1623            31             2             7 \n(40000,50000] \n            1 \n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be hard to believe now but you now know almost everything about doing ggplot2 figures. :) Everything else, all the amazing complexity of the possible ggplot2 figures (really, look at that website!) comes down from _combining these two simple elements: aesthetics and geoms.\n\nLet’s demonstrate the layering aspect a little bit more by adding more layers to our figure! Use a xlab() function to add an x-axis label element using the + operator. Look at ?xlab to see how to use this function in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as we did with tidyverse %&gt;% data transformation pipelines, as a ggplot2 visualization pipeline gets more complex, it’s a good idea to introduce indentation so that each visualization steps is on its own line.\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"Time period [years before present]\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow continue adding y-axis label with the ylab() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"Time period [years before present]\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of individuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your figure a proper main title using the function ggtitle().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"Time period [years before present]\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of individuals\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of sample counts in each time period\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough individual functions xlab(), ylab(), ggtitle() are useful, oftentimes it’s better to use a general function labs(). Look up its documentation under ?lab, then rewrite the code for your figure to use only this function, replacing your uses of xlab(), ylab(), and ggtitle() just with labs(). Note that the function has other useful arguments – go ahead and use as many of them as you want.\nNote: Don’t worry about making your figure cluttered, this is just for practice. In a real paper, you wouldn’t use title or caption directly in a ggplot2 figure, but it’s definitely useful for work-in-progress reports at meetings, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number of individuals\",\n    x = \"Time period [years before present]\",\n    title = \"Distribution of sample counts in each time period\",\n    subtitle = \"Counts for individuals in 1000 Genomes Project and MesoNeo data\",\n    caption = \"Here is an optional caption for the figure, similarly to what\n      you might do in a real scientific article as a more detailed description of\n      of what is going on in the plot.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the “present-day” bin completely overwhelms the number of individuals in the oldest bins. This often happens with data which follow a more or less exponential scale. A useful trick is adding a + scale_y_log() layer. You can probably guess what it does, so try adding it to your code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this function transforms the y-axis on the logarithmic scale! Very useful!\n\nggplot(metadata, aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number of individuals\",\n    x = \"Time period [years before present]\",\n    title = \"Distribution of sample counts in each time period\",\n    subtitle = \"Counts for individuals in 1000 Genomes Project and MesoNeo data\",\n    caption = \"Here is an optional caption for the figure, similarly to what\n      you might do in a real scientific article as a more detailed description of\n      of what is going on in the plot.\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the order of adding layers with the + operator matter? Do a little experiment to figure it out!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, generally, it doesn’t. This is another very useful feature of ggplot2. Remember that a huge important part of an R data science workflow is interactive communication with an R console. You can start with a little bit of code which produces a basic outline of your figure and continue adding useful bits and pieces to it, modifying the outcome as you go. Almost like an artist!\n\n\n\n\nIt’s useful to keep in mind that you can always pipe a data frame into a ggplot() function using the %&gt;% operator, which always places that table as the first argument in the ggplot() call, where the function expects it. I.e., instead of writing ggplot(metadata, aes(...)), you can also do metadata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(...)). This allows you to transform or summarize data before plotting, which makes the combination of tidyverse and ggplot2 infinitely stronger.\nAs a refresher and for a bit more practice, filter() the metadata first for individuals who are 10000 years or older, discarding the rest. Then pipe this filter() result into your ggplot() code, keeping the plotting part exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata %&gt;%\nfilter(age &gt; 10000) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = age_bin)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number of individuals\",\n    x = \"Time period [years before present]\",\n    title = \"Distribution of sample counts in each time period\",\n    subtitle = \"Counts for individuals in 1000 Genomes Project and MesoNeo data\",\n    caption = \"Here is an optional caption for the figure, similarly to what\n      you might do in a real scientific article as a more detailed description of\n      of what is going on in the plot.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, with this basic structure of ggplot2 visualization and combining this with any other type of tidyverse manipulation, filtering, and (as we’ll later see), summarization, you’re ready to make any figure imaginable. Let’s take this one step further.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Distribution of a numerical variable\nIn the previous exercise you visualized a distribution of a categorical variable, specifically the counts of samples in an age category. Now let’s look at continuous variables and this time consider our ibd table if IBD segments between pairs of individuals:\n\ntail(ibd_merged)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 18\n  sample1    sample2 country_pair  region_pair time_pair chrom start   end rel  \n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 NEO232     HG00729 Russia:China  Asia:Asia   (0,10000…    21 37.6  39.9  none \n2 VK276      NEO957  Denmark:Denm… Europe:Eur… (0,10000…    21 48.4  52.9  none \n3 SMP5       NA18637 Peru:China    America:As… (0,10000…    21 35.8  39.6  none \n4 Latvia_HG3 NEO749  Latvia:Denma… Europe:Eur… (0,10000…    21 37.3  39.6  none \n5 NEO164     HG00097 Russia:UK     Europe:Eur… (0,10000…    21 50.1  52.1  none \n6 HG01812    HG01816 China:China   Asia:Asia   present-…    21  6.77  9.75 none \n# ℹ 9 more variables: length &lt;dbl&gt;, country1 &lt;chr&gt;, continent1 &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   age1 &lt;dbl&gt;, age_bin1 &lt;fct&gt;, country2 &lt;chr&gt;, continent2 &lt;chr&gt;, age2 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   age_bin2 &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\nThe most interesting quantity we might want to analyse in the IBD context is the length of IBD segments, which can indicate the degree of genetic affinity or relatedness between individuals. So let’s take a look at the distribution of IBD lengths across our data set as an opportunity to introduce new functionality and useful tricks of ggplot2.\n\ngeom_histogram() and geom_density()\nYou can visualize a distribution of values using the functions geom_histogram() and geom_density(). Both are useful for similar things, each has its strengths and weaknesses from a visualization perspective.\nVisualize the distribution of length values across all individuals in your IBD data set, starting with the basic simple patterns of:\n\nggplot() + geom_histogram(), or\nggplot() + geom_density(),\n\njust like you did in the previous geom_bar() example. Of course, you have to fill in the aes() accordingly. Try to use the knowledge you obtained in the previous exercise!

Do this in two versions again, using geom_histogram() or geom_density(). Additionally, for each of the two functions specify either fill or color (or both of them!) based on the variable country_pair.

This topic boils down to the question of “How many dimensions of our data can we represent in a single figure and be it as comprehensible as possible?” which is more and more important the more complex (and interesting!) our questions become.\nLooking at the figures of IBD length distributions again (both histograms and densities), it’s clear there’s a lot of overlapping information that is a little hard to interpret. In situations like this, facetting can be very helpful.\nFaceting is easier to demonstrate than explain, so just go ahead, take your IBD segment length histogram plot created by geom_histogram() and add + facet_wrap(~ country_pair) at the end. How do you interpret the result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(length, fill = country_pair)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ country_pair)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

In general, personally, I think that figures which show the same statistic across different categories should generally use the same scales on both x- and y-axes, because this makes each facet comparable to each other.\nBut there are pros and cons to doing all of these in different situations!\n\n\n\n\n\nTry practicing more faceting by visualizing the histogram of coverage from the metadata table, facetted by age_bin.\nHint: You might have to adjust the scales = argument of facet_wrap() to make the histogram meaningful.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetadata %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(coverage, fill = age_bin)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ age_bin, scales = \"free_y\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

We’ll quantify how much a bit later, but for now, the x-axis appears in the density plot is too spread out. This happens often in visualizing numerical variables. Use these two additional layers to improve the readability of your figures by restricting the range of the x-axis of your figures:\n\nAdd this layer + xlim(0, 10) to your figure,\nor this layer + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10)).\n\nWhat’s the difference between both possibilities?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the two versions of restricting the x-axis scale. Note that they differ only by the command used at the 5th line!\n\ncoord_cartesian() performs so-called “soft clipping” – it restricts the “viewpoint” on the entire data set:\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxlim() does “hard clipping” – it effectively removes the points outside of the given range. This usually isn’t what we want, so I personally rarely if ever use this:\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  xlim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly they both give the same result, but that’s not always the case, so be careful!\n\n\n\n\nIs there evidence of some countries sharing more IBD sequence within themselves. If that’s the case, it could be a result of a stronger population bottleneck. The previous density plot is a little too busy to be able to see this, so filter your ibd_eur table for rows in which country1 is the same as country2, and then %&gt;% pipe it into the usual ggplot2 density command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  filter(country1 == country2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  xlim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there are more IBD sequence shared within Finland, which is consistent with a previously established hypothesis that ancestors of present-day Finns experienced a strong popularion bottleneck.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s introduce another useful geom for visualization of this type of numerical data, the boxplot! You can visualize boxplots with the function geom_boxplot(), and calling (in our case right here) aes(x = country_pair, y = length, color = country) within the ggplot() function. Adjust your previous density example according to these instructions to show boxplots instead!\nWhen you have your boxplots, swap out geom_boxplot() for geom_violin().\nNote: Hopefully you can see now how super modular and customizable ggplot2 for making many different types of visualizations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  filter(country1 == country2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country_pair, y = length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  ylim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  filter(country1 == country2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country_pair, y = length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  labs(y = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  ylim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m personally a much bigger fan of the violin plot for this kind of purpose, because I feel like boxplot hides too much about the distribution of the data.\nOn that note, another useful trick we haven’t mentioned yet is that we can plot multiple geoms from the same data! You’re already quite familiar with the ggplot2 concept of layering functions on top of each other using the + operator. What happens when you add + geom_jitter(size = 0.3, color = \"darkgray\") after the line with geom_violin()? How do you read the resulting figure?\nNote: We specified color = \"darkgray\", which effectively overrides the color = country_pair assigned in the ggplot() call (and which normally sets the color for every single geom we would add to our figure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_jitter() is extremely useful to really clearly see the true distribution of our data points (which is often otherwise hidden by the “summarizing geoms”, such as boxplot above – one reason why I’m not a fan of boxplots, as I mentioned!):\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  filter(country1 == country2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country_pair, y = length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_jitter(size = 0.3, color = \"darkgray\") +\n  labs(y = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  ylim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think happens when you exchange the order of geom_violin() and geom_jitter(...) in your previous solution? Why does the order matter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 arranges elements on a canvas literally like a painter would, if an element is added and another element is added later, the latter can (partially) overlap the former:\n\nibd_eur %&gt;%\n  filter(country1 == country2) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = country_pair, y = length, color = country_pair)) +\n  geom_jitter(size = 0.3, color = \"darkgray\") + # we flipped the order\n  geom_violin() +                               # of these two geoms\n  labs(y = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\") +\n  ylim(0, 10)\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_ydensity()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 23 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this can also be intentional sometimes! It all depends on the aesthetic you’re going for as a visualization artist. :)\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermezzo: Saving ggplot2 figures to PDF\nLooking at figures in RStudio is useful for exploratory analysis, but when we want to use a figure in a paper or a presentation, we need to save it to disk. Doing this is very easy using the function ggsave().\nThere are generally three options:\n\nSimply running a ggplot2 command, and calling ggsave() right after to save a single figure. Something like this:\n\n\n# we first plot a figure by running this in the R console:\nggplot(ibd_eur, aes(length, fill = country_pair)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\")\n\n# this then saves the last figure to a given file\nggsave(\"~/Desktop/ibd_length_histogram.pdf\")\n\n\nOr, sometimes in a larger script (like we’ll see later), it’s useful to actually save a ggplot to a variable (yes, you can do that!), and then give that variable to a ggsave(). This is useful when you want to first create multiple plots, store them in their own variables, then save them to files at once. Something like this:\n\n\n# we first create a histogram plot\np_histogram &lt;- ggplot(ibd_eur, aes(length, fill = country_pair)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\")\n\n# then we create a density plot\np_density &lt;- ggplot(ibd_eur, aes(length, fill = country_pair)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(x = \"IBD segment length [centimorgans]\")\n\n# note that if you type the variable into your R console (try this please!),\n# you will get your figure visualized:\np_histogram\n\n# we can save figures stored in variables like this\nggsave(\"~/Desktop/ibd_length_histogram.pdf\", p_histogram)\nggsave(\"~/Desktop/ibd_length_density.pdf\", p_density)\n\n\nSave multiple figures into a single PDF. This requires a different approach, in which we first initialize a PDF file, then we have to print(!) individual variables with each ggplot2 figure, and then close that PDF file. Yes, this is confusing, but don’t worry about the technical details of it!\n\n\n# this creates an empty PDF\npdf(\"~/Desktop/multiple_plots.pdf\")\n\n# we have to print(!) individual variables with each plot\nprint(p_histogram)\nprint(p_density)\n\n# this closes the PDF\ndev.off()\n\nI don’t think it’s very interesting to create a specific exercise for it. Just try running these thre examples on your own, and see what happens! We’ll be using these techniques a lot in the next session, so just keep them in mind for now..\nNote: Take a peek at ?ggsave and ?pdf help pages to see customization options, particularly on the sizes of the PDFs. Also, how would you create a PNG images with the figures? Use the help pages!\n\n\nExercise 5: Relationship between two variables\n\ngeom_point()\nWe’ll now look at creating another type of visualization which is extremely useful and very common: a scatter plot!\nBut first, let’s do some more data summarization so that we can demonstrate building of scatter plots using ggplot2. At this point, this should all be a piece of cake for you!\nThe previous figures showed distributions of individual segment lengths on present-day individuals only. Another useful quantity is the number of segments shared between a pair of individuals and the total number of IBD sequence between those pairs.\nPractice your knowledge of group_by() and summarize() and apply them to our huge ibd_segments table, to achieve the following:\n\nStart with our original big IBD table ibd_segments (not the smaller ibd_eur!)\nfilter() for rows in which region_pair == \"Europe:Europe\" (only pairs within Europe, just as we did before),\nfilter() for rows in which length &gt; 10 (only long IBD segments)\nfilter() for rows in which age_bin1 == age_bin2 (only individuals from the same age bin),\ngroup_by() to create groupings based on sample1, sample2, country_pair, region_pair, and time_pair,\nsummarize() to create two new quantities n_ibd = n() and total_ibd = sum(length) (total number of long IBD segments and their total sequence for each of individuals).\n\nSave the result of your %&gt;% pipeline implementing the steps 1.-3. above in a variable ibd_sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, once you know the functions filter(), group_by(), and summarize(), implementing the pipeline is just a matter of sequencing them together as if you were building a LEGO set!\n\nibd_sum &lt;-\n  ibd_merged %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    length &gt; 10 &          # only long IBD segments\n    age_bin1 == age_bin2   # only IBD pairs within the same time window\n  ) %&gt;% \n  group_by(sample1, sample2, rel, country_pair, region_pair, time_pair) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n_ibd = n(), total_ibd = sum(length))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'sample1', 'sample2', 'rel',\n'country_pair', 'region_pair'.

To move to more complex and interesting visualization, execute this command which reads the ibd_long just like you created it yourself, except based on all chromosomes in the entire genome.

We know that related individuals share a large amounts of IBD sequence between each other. As a reminder, the entire human genome spans about 3000 centimorgans. Can you guess from your figure which pairs of individuals (a point on your figure representing one such pair) could be potentially closely related?\nNote: Don’t worry about this too much, just take a guess.

What happens when you color points based on the values in this column inside the aes() function (i.e., set color = rel)? Similarly, what happens when you set shape = rel?\nLook at a figure from this huge study of IBD patterns and their relationship to the degree of relatedness between individuals?

I woudln’t want that in my paper, and we will show a potential solution to this soon! For now, let’s keep going.\n\nWe’re approching something which isn’t far from a publication quality figure. To get even closer, use the + labs() layer function to properly annotate your x and y axes, and give your figure a nice title too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_sum %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_ibd, y = n_ibd, color = rel)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"total IBD sequence\", y = \"number of IBD segments\",\n       title = \"Total IBD sequence vs number of IBD segments\",\n       subtitle = \"Both quantities computed only on IBD segments 10 cM or longer\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Multiple data sets in one plot\nSo far we’ve always followed this pattern of ggplot2 usage, to borrow our very first geom_histogram() example just for the sake of explanation:\n\nggplot(ibd_segments, aes(length)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you can also do this and it will give the same result (try it– it will come in handy many times in the future!):\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(data = ibd_segments, aes(length))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, each geom_&lt;...&gt;() function accepts both data data frame and also its own aes() aesthetic and mapping function. You could think of this as each individual geom having a “self-contained” ggplot() function’s ability.\nThis can be very useful whenever you want to plot different geoms with their own aesthetic parameters (colors, shapes, sizes)! Let’s work through an exercise to explain this better, step by step, to make our IBD scatter plot figure much more nicer to look at.\n\nAbove I complained a little bit how the “none” related data points are given just as strikingly colorful points as data points of interest. What we want to establish is different visual treatments of different kinds of data. Here’s one solution to do this (which will also demonstrate a very very useful ggplot2 trick).\nFirst, take your ibd_sum_total table and create two versions of it using filter() like this:\n\nibd_unrel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel == \"none\")\nibd_rel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel != \"none\")\n\nThe first table contains only those pairs of individuals with missing information about relatedness, the second one contains only those rows with this information present.\nPrint out the ibd_unrel and ibd_rel tables to make sure they both contain the same columns, even though they have different rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nibd_unrel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel == \"none\")\nhead(ibd_unrel, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 9\n  sample1 sample2 rel   country_pair    region_pair   time_pair   distance n_ibd\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0LS10   NEO224  none  Estonia:Sweden  Europe:Europe (2500,5000… 0.01304…     1\n2 0LS10   V10     none  Estonia:Estonia Europe:Europe (2500,5000… 0            1\n3 0LS10   V14     none  Estonia:Estonia Europe:Europe (2500,5000… 0.00103…     1\n# ℹ 1 more variable: total_ibd &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\nibd_rel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel != \"none\")\nhead(ibd_rel, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 9\n  sample1 sample2 rel        country_pair   region_pair time_pair distance n_ibd\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 DA104   DA105   1st degree Kyrgyzstan:Ky… Asia:Asia   (0,2500]… 0           54\n2 DA334   DA335   1st degree Russia:Russia  Asia:Asia   (2500,50… 0           50\n3 DA336   DA338   1st degree Russia:Russia  Asia:Asia   (2500,50… 0           48\n# ℹ 1 more variable: total_ibd &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen visualize the ibd_unrel (i.e., IBD summaries between unrelated individuals) table with the following “template”.\nNote: The ggplot() in this case has no arguments, just like we showed in the two versions of geom_histogram() above! Take a look at that example again if you need to. In our case here, similarly, everything is in the geom_point() call!\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = &lt;DATA FRAME&gt;, aes(&lt;ADD WHAT IS NEEDED&gt;), color = \"lightgray\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_unrel, aes(x = n_ibd, y = total_ibd), color = \"lightgray\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow visualize the scatter plot of pairs of individuals which are known to be related, ibd_rel, so something looking like this:\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = &lt;DATA FRAME&gt;, aes(&lt;ADD WHAT IS NEEDED&gt;, color = rel)) +\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_rel, aes(x = n_ibd, y = total_ibd, color = rel))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the two figures you just created, based on ibd_rel and ibd_unrel to the complete figure based on ibd_sum you created above. You can see that these to plots together are showing the same data.\n\nYou have now plotted the two scatter plots separately, but here comes a very cool aspect of ggplot2 I wanted to show you. You can combine the two figures, each plotting a different data frame, into one! Do this now and to make the figure even nicer (and even publication ready!), add proper x and y labels, overall plot title as well as subtitle (all using the labs() layer functions) as well as adjust the legend title (just like you did with the guides() layer function above).\nIn the geom_point() command plotting unrelated individuals (ibd_unrel), in addition to setting color = \"lightgray\", set also size = 0.75.\nHint: If it still isn’t clear, don’t worry. Here’s a bit of help of what your plotting code should look like:\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(&lt;YOUR CODE PLOTTING UNRELATED IBD PAIRS&gt;)\n  geom_point(&lt;YOUR CODE PLOTTING RELATED IBD PAIRS&gt;) +\n  labs(&lt;x, y, title, and subtitle text&gt;) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(\"relatedness\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the complete solution to this exercise:\n\nibd_unrel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel == \"none\")\nibd_rel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel != \"none\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_unrel, aes(x = total_ibd, y = n_ibd), color = \"lightgray\", size = 0.75) +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_rel, aes(x = total_ibd, y = n_ibd, color = rel)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"total IBD sequence\",\n    y = \"number of IBD segments\",\n    title = \"Total IBD sequence vs number of IBD segments\",\n    subtitle = \"Both quantities computed only on IBD segments 10 cM or longer\"\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"relatedness\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a bonus, and to learn another parameter of aes() useful for scatter plots, in addition to setting color = rel (which sets a color of each point based on the relatedness value), add also shape = rel! Observe what happens when you do this!\nFinally, I’m not personally fan of the default grey-filled background of ggplots. I like to add + theme_minimal() at the end of my plotting code of many of my figures, particularly when I’m creating visualizations for my papers. Try it too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the complete solution to this exercise:\n\nibd_unrel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel == \"none\")\nibd_rel &lt;- filter(ibd_sum, rel != \"none\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_unrel, aes(x = total_ibd, y = n_ibd), color = \"lightgray\", size = 0.75) +\n  geom_point(data = ibd_rel, aes(x = total_ibd, y = n_ibd, color = rel, shape = rel)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"total IBD sequence\",\n    y = \"number of IBD segments\",\n    title = \"Total IBD sequence vs number of IBD segments\",\n    subtitle = \"Both quantities computed only on IBD segments 10 cM or longer\"\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    color = guide_legend(title = \"relatedness\"),\n    shape = guide_legend(title = \"relatedness\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()",

There are many more useful things to learn, but let’s switch gears a little bit and look at a slightly different kind of data set, just to keep things interesting.\nFirst, create a new script and save it as f4ratio.R.\nThen add the following couple of lines of setup code, which again loads the necessary libraries and also reads a new example data set:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nf4ratio &lt;- read_tsv(\"https://tinyurl.com/simgen-f4ratio\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nThis data set contains results from a huge population genetics simulation study I recently did, and contains estimates of the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in a set of European individuals spanning the past 50 thousand years.\nHere’s a brief description of the contents of the columns:\n1 individual, time – name and time (in years before present) of an individual 2. statistic – a variant of an estimator of Neanderthal ancestry 3. proportion – the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry estimated by statistic 4. rate_eur2afr – the amount of ancient migration (gene flow) from Europe to Africa in a given scenario 5. replicate – the replicate number of a simulation run (each scenario was run multiple times to capture the effect of stochasticity)\n\nhead(f4ratio)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  individual  time statistic       proportion rate_eur2afr replicate\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 eur_1      40000 direct f4-ratio   0.00687             0         1\n2 eur_2      38000 direct f4-ratio   0.00807             0         1\n3 eur_3      36000 direct f4-ratio   0.00192             0         1\n4 eur_4      34000 direct f4-ratio   0.0245              0         1\n5 eur_5      32000 direct f4-ratio   0.000390            0         1\n6 eur_6      30000 direct f4-ratio  -0.00267             0         1\n\n\nIn other words, each row of this table contains the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry estimated for a given individual at a given time in some scenario specified by a given set of other parameters (rate_afr2afr, rate_eur2afr, replicate).\nIn this exercise, I will be asking you some questions, the answers to which you should be able to arrive to by the set of techniques from tidyverse you’ve already learned, and visualize them using the ggplot2 functions you already know. When a new function will be needed, I will be dropping hints for you along the way!\nThis exercise is primarily intended for you to practice more ggplot2 visualization, because I think this is the most crucial skill in doing any kind of data analysis. Why? The faster you can get from an idea to a visualization of that idea, the faster you’ll be able to do research.\nYes, we could do this on the MesoNeo metadata or the IBD data too, but I think it would be too boring to stay with the same set of tables for this long. :)\nLet’s go!\n\nUse geom_point() to plot the relationship between time (x axis) andpropotionof Neanderthal ancestry (y` axis). Don’t worry about any other variables just yet (colors, facet, etc.).\nNote: The f4ratio table is too huge to plot every single point. Before you %&gt;% pipe it into ggplot(), subsample the rows to just 10% of it subset using this trick:\nf4ratio %&gt;%\n  sample_frac(0.1) %&gt;% # subsample 10% fraction of the data\n  ggplot(aes(...)) +\n    geom_point()\nHint: Look at ?sample_frac but also ?sample_n and check out their parameters. They are incredible useful for any kind of data exploration!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nsample_frac(0.1) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour plot now mashes together proportion values from two different statistic estimators. Fix this by facetting the plot, which will visualize both statistics in two separate panels. For the time being, keep doing the 10% subsampling step.\nHint: You can do this by adding + facet_wrap(~ statistic) to your previous code.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nsample_frac(0.1) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the values on the x-axis of your figures. Purely for aesthetics, it is customary to visualize time going from oldest (left) to present-day (right). But currently the time direction is reversed. Fix this by adding a new layer with + scale_x_reverse()!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nsample_frac(0.1) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we visualize some biological statistics, we often want to compare their values to some kind of baseline (or a null hypothesis) value. In our case we have two:\n\nbaseline of “no Neanderthal ancestry” at y-axis value 0,\nbaseline of “known proportion of Neanderthal ancestry” today, which is about 3% (so y-axis value of 0.03).\n\nAdd those two baselines to your figure using a new function geom_hline() (standing for “horizontal line”). Like this:\n&lt;YOUR TIDYVERSE AND GGPLOT2 CODE ABOVE&gt; +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dotted\")\nNote: You can immediately see the possibilities for adjusting the visuals like colors or linetype. Feel free to experiment with this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nsample_frac(0.1) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s clearly a huge amount of statistical noise, represented particularly in the “indirect f4-ratio” figure. And we’re not even plotting all points because there’s just too many of them!\nAdditionally, what I cared about in this particular case (during my PhD) were not values for each individual person, but about the statistical trend in my data. An extremely important function for this is geom_smoot(), which fits a line through the data, capturing this trend.\nIn this next part, remove the subsampling done by sample_frac(), and also replace your geom_point() call in your figure with this: + geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", se = FALSE). What happens when you do this? Read ?geom_line to figure out what se = FALSE means. Why do we want to do this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, we removed a lot of noise but we also removed most of the interesting signal! This is because we are now basically “smoothing” (averaging) over a very important variable: the amount of migration from Europe to Africa (which was the primary research interest for me at the time). Let’s take a look at our table again:\n\nhead(f4ratio)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  individual  time statistic       proportion rate_eur2afr replicate\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 eur_1      40000 direct f4-ratio   0.00687             0         1\n2 eur_2      38000 direct f4-ratio   0.00807             0         1\n3 eur_3      36000 direct f4-ratio   0.00192             0         1\n4 eur_4      34000 direct f4-ratio   0.0245              0         1\n5 eur_5      32000 direct f4-ratio   0.000390            0         1\n6 eur_6      30000 direct f4-ratio  -0.00267             0         1\n\n\nWhat we want is to plot not just a single line across every single scenario, but we want to plot one line for each value of our variable of interest, rate_eur2afr.\nLet’s add the variable into play by adding color = rate_eur2afr into your aes() call in the ggplot() function (i.e., in addition to the x = time and y = proportion you already got there).\nNote: You’ll get a warning which we will fix in the next step, don’t worry!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion, color = rate_eur2afr)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\nThe following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about the warning, we’ll fix this soon!\n\n\n\n\nThe reason we got a warning here is a slightly confusing behavior of the smoothing function geom_smooth(). Because rate_eur2afr is a numerical variable, the smoothing function cannot plot a single smoothed line for each of its values, because there could be infinite numnber of them.\nFix the problem by adding group = rate_eur2afr right after your color = rate_eur2afr you added in the previous exercise. This explicitly instructs geom_smooth() to treat individual values of rate_eur2afr as discrete categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion, color = rate_eur2afr, group = rate_eur2afr)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s finalize our figure for publication! Use labs() to add proper x, y, and title descriptions (something like “Neanderthal ancestry proportion”, “years before present”, and “Expected Neanderthal ancestry trajectories”).\nDon’t forget about the title of the legend too, which you can adjust by + guides(color = guide_legend(\"EUR -&gt; AFR\\nmigration\")).\nFinally, add my favourite + theme_minimal() at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf4ratio %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(time, proportion, color = rate_eur2afr, group = rate_eur2afr)) +\n  geom_line(stat = \"smooth\", se = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ statistic) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.03, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = \"Neanderthal ancestry proportion\",\n       y = \"years before present\",\n       title = \"Expected Neanderthal ancestry trajectories\",\n       subtitle = \"Results from a set of population genetic simulations\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(\"EUR -&gt; AFR\\nmigration\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that you now appreciate how adding little bits and pieces, one step at a time (and each step being very tiny and easily understandable!), makes it possible to create beautiful informative visualizations of any kind of tabular data!\n\n\nExercise 8: Combining figures\nTODO: Logscale vs normal scale\nSo, here’s an extremely cool revelation. Do you remember how we went through various data types and object classes in the R bootcamp? Numeric, logical, character types, etc?\nggplot() functions actually do return a (hidden) value, which is a normal object like any other R value! The fact that we immediately see a plot visualized is “just” a side effect that R provides for convenience! After all, when we write plotting code, we usually want to see the plot, right?\nWhat does this mean? Well, first of all, consider this bit of code:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot()\n\nWeird, huh? Why would you do that? When you type p1 in your R console you get the usual (empty) figure!\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we can also create (and save in a variable) a full figure like this:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(ibd_segments, aes(length)) + geom_histogram()\np1\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also create and save another figure, this time a density:\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(ibd_segments, aes(length)) + geom_density()\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is extremely useful for making composite figures built out of individual panels (like you often see in scientific figures as panels A, B, C, etc.). The way we can do this is using a helper R package cowplot (don’t ask me about its name, I have no idea! :)) and its function plot_gri(). Check this out:\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nplot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

The sky is actually a limit, because you can place other plot_grid() calls within another plot_grid(), composing figures of various levels of complexity. Check out a figure from one of my papers, each panel is an independently made ggplot2 figure, all pasted together with plot_grid().\nFor instance, if we make p3 like this:\n\n# create a silly scatter plot of geographical coordinates of our samples\n# (do you see an outline of Europe? :))\np3 &lt;-\n  metadata %&gt;%\n  filter(continent == \"Europe\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(longitude, latitude)) +\n    geom_point()\np3\n\nWarning: Removed 405 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could combine them like this (this is just an example, don’t read too much into the meaning of putting these particular plots together).\n\nplot_grid(\n  p3,\n  plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c(\"B\", \"C\")),\n  nrow = 2,\n  labels = \"A\"\n)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 405 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).",

I hope we’ll get through some spatial visualization features of R (which are tightly linked with tidyverse and ggplot2 in the modern R data science landscape), but there’s much more I wish we had time to go through.\nHere are a couple of resources for you to study after the conclusion of the workshop, or even during the workshop itself if you find yourself with more time and more energy to study.\n\nFactors are both a curse and blessing. When dealing with visualization, often a curse, because our factors are rarely ordered in the way we want. If our factors are numerical but not straightforward numbers (like our age_bin column above), their order in ggplot2 figures is often wrong. forcats is an incredible package which helps with this. Read about it in this vignette and then experiment with using it for figures in this session which featured factors.\ncowplot is another R package that’s very useful for complex composite figures. We touched upon it in this session, but only extremely vaguely. Study this introduction to learn much more about its features! You will never need Inkscape again.\nggridges is a very cool package to visualize densities across multiple categories. It can often lead to much more informative figures compared to overlapping geom_density() plots we did in our session. Here’s a great official introduction to the package.",

There are endless possibilities but a good guidelines are:\n\nBe consistent – put files that “belong together” in the same place (i.e., in the same directory). For example, an Excel table shouldn’t be saved in a directory with scripts, a PDF with a plot shouldn’t be in a directory with tables.\nBe predictable – even a person unfamiliar with your project should be able to guess where is what just by looking at your folder. Remember, when you publish your paper or your thesis, you will have to provide all your data and scripts as supplementary materials, so others should be able to understand all of them!\nDocument everything – write a lot of # comments in code, describing what different pieces of code do, and why you wrote things in a certain way. Your future self will thank you!\n\n\nNow let’s set up an example computational project structure for our IBD data our ancient DNA metadata (we’ll leave the \\(f_4\\)-ratio Neanderthal estimates for next chapter), just like you would do this for a real study.\nNote: This is all just an example! Again, as long as you follow the guidelines numbered above, everything works!\nIn the Files pane of RStudio, click on \"New Folder\" and create the following directories in the “root of your project directory simgen-project/”:\n\ncode/\ndata/, and within it create directories raw/ and processed/\nfigures/\nresults/\nreports/\n\nNote: You can do all this manually, or you can play around with doing it using code with the incredibly useful function ?dir.create! For instance, a single command to do all of the above could be the following. (If you’re curious about the recursive = TRUE, look at help of ?dir.create.)\n\ndir.create(\"code/\")\ndir.create(\"data/raw\", recursive = TRUE)\ndir.create(\"data/processed\", recursive = TRUE)\ndir.create(\"figures/\")\ndir.create(\"results/\")\ndir.create(\"reports/\")\n\n\nWhen you hit the \"Refresh file listing\" circular arrow button in the top-right of the \"Files\" pane, you should now see all the directories you just created.

    "text": "Exercise 3: Building an example reproducible pipeline\nLet’s get something out of the way first. Of course, if there are a million possible ways how to properly structure a computational project, there are infinite ways how a “reproducible research pipeline” should be actually organized.\nObviously, all research projects are different, they focus on different kinds of data (archaeological data, ancient DNA sequences, linguistic data, field observation data, etc.), so naturally they will require different code which will have to be structured in different ways.\nStill, there are some common workflows which practically every single computational scientific research study does:\n\nData gathering – in our IBD and metadata examples, this involved downloading data from the internet.\nData processing – in our case, this involved filtering the data, processing it to bin individuals based on their ages, joining IBD data with metadata, etc.\nData analysis – this involves computing summary statistics, creating figures, etc.\n\nThe dirty secret of many scientific research studies (especially in the “old days”) is that all of these steps are often clumped together in huge scripts, and its very difficult (even for the author) to sometimes tell where is what. This can be a big problem, especially if a bug needs to be fixed, a new step of a processing pipeline needs to be added, etc.\nIt gets even worse, when after a long time you come back to a project and need to remember some details about where in your code is that one line that does something that needs changing!\nLet’s demonstrate how you could organize your code in practice, and hopefully you’ll see how investing a bit more time and thinking into properly organizing code in your research project makes your life a lot easier in the long run (and much easier for everyone who might pick up your project later too).\n\n\n1. Data gathering\nCreate a standalone R script (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script). Paste the following code to that script, and then save it as 01_download_data.R in the root of your simgen-project project directory.\nDon’t copy it without skimming through it and understanding it! You should recognize these commands from our earlier exercises on tidyverse? Ideally, you’ve written those commands before yourself. That example code was a little messy and random, because it was structured as an ad hoc tutorial. What we’re doing here is showing how to organize computational research properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the complete script here.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have your script 01_download_data.R, run it by calling source(\"01_download_data.R\") in your R console and observe what happens. You can also press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S — a very useful shortcut!\nThen, click through your \"Files\" panel and look in data/raw — do you see files that your new script should create?\nNote: Notice the cat(\"some kind of message\\n\") command in the script. This is extremely useful for printing log information about a (potentially) log running process. If you’re confused about what it does, write this into your R console: cat(\"Hello friend!\\n\").\n\nCreating 01_download_data.R is a first step towards reproducibility. Downloading of all data set now happens in a dedicated script, which means:\n\nWe only have to run it once, and have all data available in data/raw for later use.\nIf we have to include a new data set to be included, we just edit that script 01_download_data.R and run it again!\nExcept for running the script top to bottom, we don’t do any “manual work”.\n\nThis doesn’t sound like much, but it’s absolutely crucial. Automation is the most important aspect of reproducible research. Unless something isn’t fully automated, it’s not reproducible.\nNow let’s move to the next step!\n\n\n\n2. Data processing\nCreate a standalone R script (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script). Add the following code to that script, and then save it as 02_process_data.R in the root of your simgen-project project directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the complete script here.\n\n\n\nAgain, please don’t just blindly copy it! Look at the script and try to recognize the commands from our earlier exercises on tidyverse. You ran all of this yourself, manually, command-by-command, in the R console.\nWhen you have your script, close RStudio.\n…\nLet’s pretend that some time passed, you’re done for the day and went home.\n…\nFind the location of your simgen-project directory on your computer, go to that directory, and then double-click on the R project file simgen-project.Rproj. You’ll get your old session back, just like you left it (including history!\n\nNow press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to run the processing script, and observe what happens! Then click through your \"Files\" panel and look in data/processed — do you see your files, process and tidy, ready for analysis?\n\n\n\n3. Data analysis\nHopefully you’re now starting to get an idea about what a well-organized, reproducible pipeline means. It’s about structuring the directory where your project lives, and about partitioning your code into scripts which represent logical components of your project — from downloading data (and saving it to a particular storage location), and processing it (and again saving it to a proper storage location), and, finally, to answering research questions based on this data.\nYour project structure should now look something like this. Notice that there are already data files present, not just directories:\n├── 01_download_data.R           # data fetching code\n├── 02_process_data.R            # data processing code\n├── code                         # directory for future custom functions\n├── data\n│   ├── processed                # processed / filter / cleaned data\n│   │   ├── ibd_segments.tsv\n│   │   ├── ibd_sum.tsv\n│   │   └── metadata.tsv\n│   └── raw                      # raw unprocessed data\n│       ├── ibd_segments.tsv\n│       └── metadata.tsv\n├── figures                      # location for PDF figures\n├── results                      # various other output data (tables, cache files, etc.)\n├── reports                      # location for slides and reports (next section!)\n└── simgen-project.Rproj\nYou have implemented the first two steps of a data processing pipeline. Now it’s your job to implement additional components of the project pipeline, again using a couple of examples of what we’ve already done before, but this time properly integrating it into a nice and tidy package.\n\n\nGenerating figures\nCreate a standalone R script called 03_plot_metadata.R, which will:\n\nRead the table in data/processed/metadata.tsv using read_tsv() function.\nCreate the following figures using ggplot2 package and the function ggsave() you’ve learned about earlier.\n\n\nCount of samples in each age_bin of metadata (use geom_bar()).\nA histogram of coverage across different age_bin categories, only for individuals with age &gt; 0 (i.e., ancient individuals), with one facet showing one histogram from a given age_bin category (use geom_histogram() and facet_wrap()).\n\n\nSave the figure(s) in the figures/ directory (whether you save individual PDF for each figure, or put multiple figures into one PDF is up to you).\n\nNote: Remember that you can use the function ggsave() to save ggplot2 figures stored in normal R variables, or the pdf() & dev.off() trick!\nHint: If you need help, we solved all of these in previous exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find my solution here.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a standalone R script called 04_plot_ibd_sharing.R, which will:\n\nRead the table in data/processed/ibd_merged.tsv using read_tsv() function.\nFilter the table to only length &gt; 5 (segments longer than 5cM) and time_pair == \"present-day:present-day\" (only present-day humans).\nCreate the following figures using ggplot2 package and the function ggsave() you’ve learned about earlier, saving all of these figures into a single file figures/ibd_sharing.pdf:\n\nFor each pair of continents region_pair == \"Europe:Europe\", region_pair == \"America:America\", region_pair == \"Asia:Asia\", and region_pair == \"Africa:Africa\", plot a histogram of lengths of IBD longer than 5 cM.\nUse facet_wrap(~ country_pair) to visualize each histogram for each country pair in its own facets.\nTherefore, your PDF should have four plots (one plot per page), with each plot having a number of histograms, one histogram per facet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find my solution here.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a standalone R script called 05_plot_ibd_relatedness.R, which will:\n\nRead the table in data/processed/ibd_sum.tsv using read_tsv() function.\nRecreate that beautiful figure we made, showing a scatterplot of total_ibd against n_ibd, and highlighting which individuals are duplicated, who is a 1st degree relative, 2nd degree relative, etc.\nSave that figure to figures/ibd_relatedness.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find my solution here.",

Traditionally, this file is formatted in a Markdown format, which makes it easy to read in plain text, but is easily visualized on the web (many websites such as GitHub and other data repositories render Markdown text beautifully).\nLook up the basic syntax of Markdown formatting, then create File -&gt; New File -&gt; Markdown File (not R Markdown file!). Then write a short list (again, take a look at the Markdown syntax and read how to create a list), which will describe, in one sentence:\n\nWhich directories are in your project, and what they countain (briefly!)\nWhich scripts you created and what they do.\nWhich results are created (so far just figures), and which scripts created those results.\n\nHint: Try clicking the “Visual” button on top of your editing window. I personally don’t use it because I like to write Markdown in plain text, but it can be very helpful, because you can create lists and other formatting by clicking with the mouse, instead of having to type Markdown syntax manually.\n\nCreating a README is an important practice of documenting computational projects.

Unless you use git actively (which solves the backup problem as a side-effect—see below), you need to back up regularly. Even right-clicking your simgen-project directory, archiving it in a zip file named like \"yyyy-mm-dd-simgen-project.zip\" regularly will get you through any trouble.\ngit – an incredibly powerful version control system, which is also at the back end of the online code repository service GitHub.

This can slow things down for long-running analyses, but is very convenient otherwise.\n\nIn a Quarto document (of any kind, reports, presentations, anything), this is a very document component. It’s called a “code block”:\n```{r}\n# here is your code\n```\nWhenever a Quarto document is rendered, R executes code in these code blocks! It then includes a figure, prints the result, etc., which then becomes the part of the resulting document. I hope you can now appreciate how useful this is for:\n\nMaking your reserach more reproducible – the code and the results are part of a single document, which is ran top to bottom, automatically!\nMaking your research easier to do – this is effectively a lab notebook of your research activity for that particular project. You can write notes, comments, reminders, conclusions, etc.\n\nThis allows you to avoid hunting down for “which bit of code and where created this particular figure?”, which is very very stressful at times, especially close to deadlines.",

For the time being, these models will be always neutral and will conform to Wright-Fisher assumptions.\nUse functions such as population(), gene_flow(), and compile_model(), which we discussed in “Introduction to slendr”, to program the following toy model of human demographic history in slendr. (Apologies for my bad handwriting and the lack of any artistic skill.)\nHint: Create a new script models.R in your RStudio session using the following “template”.

By default, slendr models always produce a tree sequence.\n\n\nNote: Tree sequence provides an extremely efficient means to store and work with genomic data at a massive scale. However, you can always get simulated data even in traditional file formats, such as VCF, EIGENSTRAT, or a plain old table of ancestral/derived genotypes.\nIn this activity we will be only working with tree sequences, because it’s much easier and faster to get interesting statistics from it directly in R.\nThere are two simulation engines built into slendr implemented by functions msprime() and slim(). For traditional, non-spatial, neutral demographic models, the engine provided by the msprime() function is much more efficient, so we’ll be using that for the time being. However, from a popgen theoretical perspective, both simulation functions will give you the same results for any given compiled slendr model (up to some level of stochastic noise, of course).\n\n\nNote: Yes, this means you don’t have to write any msprime (or SLiM) code to simulate data from a slendr model!\nHere’s how you can use the function to simulate a tree sequence from the model you’ve just created using compile_model() in your script:\n\nts &lt;- msprime(\n  model,\n  sequence_length = &lt;length of sequence to simulate [as bp]&gt;,\n  recombination_rate = &lt;uniform recombination rate [per bp per generation]&gt;\n)\n\nYou will be seeing this kind of pattern over and over again in this exercise, so it’s a good idea to keep it in mind.\nHint: The msprime() function has also arguments debug and run which can be extremely useful for debugging.\nSimulate a tree sequence from your compiled model using the msprime() engine, storing it to a variable ts as shown right above. Use sequence_length = 1e6 (so 1 Mb of sequence) and recombination_rate = 1e-8 (crossover events per base pair per generation).

You should get a summary of a tree-sequence object that you’re familiar with from your msprime and tskit activity earlier in the day.\n\n\nNote: This is a very important feature of slendr – when a simulation is concluded (doesn’t matter if it was a slim() or msprime() simulation), you will get a normal tskit object. In fact, the fact that slendr supports (so far, and likely always) only a “subset” of all of tskit’s functionality isn’t stopping you to write custom Python/tskit processing code of a tree sequence generated from a slendr model. Under the hood, a slendr simulation really is just an msprime (or SLiM) simulation!

Let’s look at a couple of them now.\nUse the ts_table function to inspect the low-level table-based representation of a tree sequence. For instance, you can get the table of nodes with ts_table(ts, \"nodes\"), edges with ts_table(ts, \"edges\"), and do the same thing for “individuals”, “mutations”, and “sites”. Does your tree sequence contain any mutations? If not, why, and how can we even do any popgen with data without any mutations? As you’re doing this, take a look at at the following figure (this was made from a different tree sequence than you have, but that’s OK) to help you relate the information in the tables to a tree sequence which those tables (particularly tables of nodes and edges) implicitly encode.\nThis should convince you that the final product of a slendr simulation really is the same kind of tree-sequence object that you learned about in the previous activities today.

It’s very unlikely, unless we’re extremely lucky, that we’ll ever have a sequence of every single individual in a population that we study. To get a little closer to the scale of the genomic data that we usually work with on a day-to-day basis, we can restrict our simulation to only record a subset of individuals.\nWe can precisely define which individuals (from which populations, and at which times) should be recorded in a tree sequence using the slendr function schedule_sampling(). For instance, if we have a model with some slendr populations in variables eur and afr, we can schedule the recording of 5 individuals from each at times 10000 (years ago) and 0 (present-day) (using the “years before present” direction of time in our current model of Neanderthal introgression) with the following code:\n\npop_schedule &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = c(10000, 0), list(eur, 5), list(afr, 5))\n\nThis function simply returns a data frame. As such, we can create multiple of such schedules (of arbitrary complexity and granularity), and then bind them together into a single sampling schedule with a single line of code, like this:\n\n# Note that the `times =` argument of the `schedule_sampling()` function can be\n# a vector of times like here...\nancient_times &lt;- c(40000, 30000, 20000, 10000)\neur_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = ancient_times, list(eur, 1))\n\n# ... but also just a single number like here\nafr_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(afr, 1))\nnea_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, time = 60000, list(nea, 1))\n\n# But whatever the means you create the individual sampling schedules with,\n# you can always bind them all to a single table with the `rbind()` function\nschedule &lt;- rbind(eur_samples, afr_samples, nea_samples)\nschedule\n\nUsing the function schedule_sampling (and with the help of rbind as shown in the previous code chunk), program the sampling of the following sample sets at given times, saving it to variable called schedule:\n\n\n\ntime\npopulation\n# individuals\n\n\n\n\n70000\nnea\n1\n\n\n40000\nnea\n1\n\n\n0\nchimp\n1\n\n\n0\nafr\n5\n\n\n0\neur\n10\n\n\n\nAdditionally, schedule the sampling of a single eur individual at the following times:\n\nt &lt;- seq(40000, 2000, by = -2000)\n\n\n\nNote: You can provide a vector variable (such as t in this example) as the times = argument of schedule_sampling().\nIn total, you should schedule the recording of 38 individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Here we scheduled the sampling of two Neanderthals at 70kya and 40kya\nnea_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = c(70000, 40000), list(nea, 1))\nnea_samples # (this function produces a plain old data frame!)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 8\n   time pop       n name  y_orig x_orig y     x    \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n1 40000 NEA       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n2 70000 NEA       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n\n# Here we schedule one Chimpanzee sample, 5 African samples, and 10 European samples\npresent_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(chimp, 1), list(afr, 5), list(eur, 10))\n\n# We also schedule the recording of one European sample between 50kya and 2kya,\n# every 2000 years\ntimes &lt;- seq(40000, 2000, by = -2000)\nemh_samples &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times, list(eur, 1))\n\n# Because those functions produce nothing but a data frame, we can bind\n# individual sampling schedules together\nschedule &lt;- rbind(nea_samples, present_samples, emh_samples)\nschedule\n\n# A tibble: 25 × 8\n    time pop       n name  y_orig x_orig y     x    \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 40000 NEA       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 2 70000 NEA       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 3     0 CHIMP     1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 4     0 AFR       5 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 5     0 EUR      10 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 6  2000 EUR       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 7  4000 EUR       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 8  6000 EUR       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n 9  8000 EUR       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n10 10000 EUR       1 NA    NA     NA     NA    NA   \n# ℹ 15 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, verify the correctness of your overall sampling schedule by visualizing it together with your model like this:\n\n\nNote: As you’ve seen above, the visualization is often a bit wonky and convoluted with overlapping elements and it can be even worse with samples added, but try to experiment with arguments to plot_model described above to make the plot a bit more helpful for sanity checking.\n\nplot_model(model, samples = schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_model(model, sizes = FALSE, samples = schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_model(model, sizes = FALSE, log = TRUE, samples = schedule)",

You can do this by providing the combined sampling schedule as the samples = schedule argument of the function msprime you used above. Just replace the line(s) with your first msprime() from the previous part of this exercise with the new one, which uses the schedule for customized sampling.\nAlso, while you’re doing this, use the ts_mutate() function to overlay neutral mutations on the simulated tree sequence right after the msprime() call.

Specifically, we will learn how to compute popgen statistics on slendr-simulated tree sequences using slendr’s interface to the tskit Python module.\nFirst, create a new R script stats.R and paste in the following code. This is one of the possible solutions to the Exercise 1, and it’s easier if we all use it to be on the same page from now on, starting from the same model and the same simulated tree sequence:\nAs a sanity check, let’s use a couple of tidyverse table-munging tricks to make sure the tree sequence does contain a set of sample which matches our intended sampling schedule (particularly the time series of European individuals and the two Neanderthals):\nEverything looks good! Having made sure that the ts object contains the individuals we want, let’s move to the exercise.\nThe toy model of ancient human history plotted above makes a fairly clear prediction of what would be the nucleotide diversity expected in the simulated populations. Compute the nucleotide diversity in all populations using the slendr function ts_diversity() in your tree sequence ts. Do you get numbers that (relatively between all populations) match what would expect from the model given the \\(N_e\\) that you programmed for each?\nHint: Nearly every slendr statistic function interfacing with tskit accepts a ts tree-sequence object as its first argument, with further arguments being either a vector of individual names representing a group of samples to compute a statistic on, or a (named) list of such vectors (each element of that list for a group of samples) – these lists are intended to be equivalent to the sample_sets = argument of many tskit Python methods (which you’ve learned about in your activity on tskit), except that they allow symbolic names of individuals, rather then integer indices of nodes in a tree sequence.\nAlthough you can get all the above information by processing the table produced by the ts_samples() function, slendr provides a useful helper function ts_names() which only returns the names of individuals as a vector (or a named list of such vectors, one vector per population as shown below).\nWhen you call it directly, you get a plain vector of individual names:\nts_names(ts)\n\n [1] \"NEA_1\"   \"EUR_1\"   \"NEA_2\"   \"EUR_2\"   \"EUR_3\"   \"EUR_4\"   \"EUR_5\"  \n [8] \"EUR_6\"   \"EUR_7\"   \"EUR_8\"   \"EUR_9\"   \"EUR_10\"  \"EUR_11\"  \"EUR_12\" \n[15] \"EUR_13\"  \"EUR_14\"  \"EUR_15\"  \"EUR_16\"  \"EUR_17\"  \"EUR_18\"  \"EUR_19\" \n[22] \"EUR_20\"  \"AFR_1\"   \"AFR_2\"   \"AFR_3\"   \"AFR_4\"   \"AFR_5\"   \"CHIMP_1\"\n[29] \"EUR_21\"  \"EUR_22\"  \"EUR_23\"  \"EUR_24\"  \"EUR_25\"  \"EUR_26\"  \"EUR_27\" \n[36] \"EUR_28\"  \"EUR_29\"  \"EUR_30\"\nThis is not super helpful, unless we want to compute some statistic for everyone in the tree sequence, regardless of their population assignment. Perhaps a bit more useful is to call the function like this, because it will produce a result which can be immediately used as the sample_sets = argument mentioned in the Hint above:\nts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\n\n$AFR\n[1] \"AFR_1\" \"AFR_2\" \"AFR_3\" \"AFR_4\" \"AFR_5\"\n\n$CHIMP\n[1] \"CHIMP_1\"\n\n$EUR\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\"\n\n$NEA\n[1] \"NEA_1\" \"NEA_2\"\nAs you can see, this gave us a normal R list, with each element containing a vector of individual names in a population.

If you are familiar with plotting in R, visualize the individual-based heterozygosities across all populations.\nHint: You can do this by giving a vector of names as sample_sets = (so not an R list of vectors). You could also use the data frame produced by ts_samples(ts) to get the names, just adding the heterozygosities to that data frame as a new column.",

    "text": "Part 3: Detecting Neanderthal admixture in Europeans\nLet’s now pretend its about 2008, we’ve sequenced the first Neanderthal genome, and we are working on a project that will change human evolution research forever. We also have the genomes of a couple of people from Africa and Europe, which we want to use to answer the most burning question of all evolutionary anthropology: “Do some people living today carry Neanderthal ancestry?”\nEarlier you’ve learned about \\(f\\)-statistics of various kinds. You have also heard that an \\(f_4\\) statistic (or its equivalent \\(D\\) statistic) can be used as a test of “treeness”. Simply speaking, for some “quartet” of individuals or population samples, they can be used as a hypothesis test of whether the history of those samples is compatible with there not having been an introgression.\nCompute the \\(f_4\\) test of Neanderthal introgression in EUR individuals using the slendr function ts_f4(). When you’re running it, you will have to provide individuals to compute the statistic using a slightly different format. Take a look at the help page available as ?ts_f4 for more information. When you’re computing the \\(f_4\\), make sure to set mode = \"branch\" argument of the ts_f4() function (we will get to why a bit later).\n\n\nNote: By default, each slendr / tskit statistic function operates on mutations, and this will switch them to use branch length (as you might know, \\(f\\)-statistics are mathematically defined using branch lengths in trees and mode = \"branch\" does exactly that).\nHint: If you haven’t learned this in your \\(f\\)-statistics lecture, you want to compute (and compare) the values of these two statistics using the slendr function ts_f4():\n\n\\(f_4\\)(&lt;some African&gt;, &lt;another African&gt;; &lt;Neanderthal&gt;, &lt;Chimp&gt;)\n\\(f_4\\)(&lt;some African&gt;, &lt;a test European&gt;; &lt;Neanderthal&gt;, &lt;Chimp&gt;),\n\nhere &lt;individual&gt; can be the name of any individual recorded in your tree sequence, such as names you saw as name column in the table returned by ts_samples(ts) (i.e. \"NEA_1\" could be used as a “representative” &lt;Neanderthal&gt; in those equations, similarly for \"CHIMP_1\" as the fourth sample in the \\(f_4\\) quarted representing the outgroup).\nTo simplify things a lot, we can understand the above equations as comparing the counts of so-called BABA and ABBA allele patterns between the quarted of samples specified in the statistics:\n\\[\nf_4(AFR, X; NEA, CHIMP) = \\frac{\\#BABA - \\#ABBA}{\\#SNPs}\n\\]\nThe first \\(f_4\\) statistic above is not expected to give values “too different” from 0 (even in case of Neanderthal introgression into Europeans) because we don’t expect two African individuals to differ “significantly” in terms of how much alleles they share with a Neanderthal (because their ancestors never met Neanderthals!). The other should – if there was a Neanderthal introgression into Europeans some time in their history – be “significantly negative”.\nIs the second of those two statistics “much more negative” than the first, as expected assuming introgression from Neanderthals into Europeans?\nWhy am I putting “significantly” and “much more negative” in quotes in the previous sentence? What are we missing here for this being a true hypothesis test as you might be accustomed to from computing \\(f\\)-statistics using a tool such as ADMIXTOOLS? (We will get to this again in the following part of this exercise.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the difference in the amount of allele sharing between two African individuals and a Neanderthal:\n\nf4_null &lt;- ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = \"AFR_2\", Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\nf4_null\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  W     X     Y     Z          f4\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFR_1 AFR_2 NEA_1 CHIMP_1 -157.\n\n\nCompute the difference in the amount of allele sharing between an African individual vs European individual and a Neanderthal:\n\nf4_alt &lt;- ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = \"EUR_1\", Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\nf4_alt\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  W     X     Y     Z           f4\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AFR_1 EUR_1 NEA_1 CHIMP_1 -3351.\n\n\nWe can see that the second test resulted in an f4 value about ~20 times more negative than the first test, indicating that a European in our test carries “significantly more” Neanderthal alleles compared to the baseline expectation of no introgression established by the comparison to an African …\n\nabs(f4_alt$f4 / f4_null$f4)\n\n[1] 21.36632\n\n\n… although this is not a real test of significance (we have no Z-score or standard error which would give us something like a p-value for the hypothesis test, as we get by jackknife procedure in ADMIXTOOLS)",

    "text": "Part 4: Detecting Neanderthal admixture in Europeans v2.0\nThe fact that we don’t get something equivalent to a p-value in these kinds of simulations is generally not a problem, because we’re often interested in establishing a trend of a statistic under various conditions, and understanding when and how its expected value behaves in a certain way. If statistical noise is a problem, we work around this by computing a statistic on multiple simulation replicates or even increasing the sample sizes.\n\n\nNote: To see this in practice, you can check out a paper in which I used this approach quite successfully on a related problem.\nOn top of that, p-value of something like an \\(f\\)-statistic (whether it’s significantly different from zero) is also strongly affected by quality of the data, sequencing errors, coverage, etc. (which can certainly be examined using simulations!). However, these are aspects of modeling which are quite orthogonal to the problem of investigating the expectations and trends of statistics given some underlying evolutionary model, which is what we’re after in these exercises.\nThat said, even in perfect simulated data, what exactly does “significantly different from zero compared to some baseline expectation” mean can be blurred by noise with simple single-individual comparisons that we did above. Let’s increase the sample size a bit to see if a statistical pattern expected in \\(f_4\\) statistic from our Neanderthal introgression model becomes more apparent.\nCompute the first \\(f_4\\) statistic (the baseline expectation between a pair of Africans) and the second \\(f_4\\) statistic (comparing an African and a European), but this time on all recorded Africans and all recorded Europeans, respectively. Plot the distributions of those two sets of statistics. This should remove lots of the uncertainty and make a statistical trend stand out much more clearly.\nHint: Whenever you need to compute something for many things in sequence, looping is very useful. One way to do compute, say, an \\(f_4\\) statistic over many individuals is by using this kind of pattern using R’s looping function lapply():\n\n# Loop over vector of individual names (variable x) and apply a given ts_f4()\n# expression on each individual (note the ts_f4(..., X = x, ...) in the code)\nlist_f4 &lt;- lapply(\n  c(\"ind_1\", \"ind_2\", ...),\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n\n# The above gives us a list of data frames, so we need to bind them all into a\n# single table for easier interpretation and visualization\ndf_f4 &lt;- do.call(rbind, list_f4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us list of vectors of the names of all individuals in each population…\n\nsample_sets &lt;- ts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\n# ... which we can then access like this\nsample_sets$AFR # all Africans\n\n[1] \"AFR_1\" \"AFR_2\" \"AFR_3\" \"AFR_4\" \"AFR_5\"\n\nsample_sets$EUR # all Europeans\n\n [1] \"EUR_1\"  \"EUR_2\"  \"EUR_3\"  \"EUR_4\"  \"EUR_5\"  \"EUR_6\"  \"EUR_7\"  \"EUR_8\" \n [9] \"EUR_9\"  \"EUR_10\" \"EUR_11\" \"EUR_12\" \"EUR_13\" \"EUR_14\" \"EUR_15\" \"EUR_16\"\n[17] \"EUR_17\" \"EUR_18\" \"EUR_19\" \"EUR_20\" \"EUR_21\" \"EUR_22\" \"EUR_23\" \"EUR_24\"\n[25] \"EUR_25\" \"EUR_26\" \"EUR_27\" \"EUR_28\" \"EUR_29\" \"EUR_30\"\n\n\nLet’s compute the f4 statistic for all Africans…\n\nf4_afr_list &lt;- lapply(\n  sample_sets$AFR,\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n# ... and Europeans\nf4_eur_list &lt;- lapply(\n  sample_sets$EUR,\n  function(x) ts_f4(ts, W = \"AFR_1\", X = x, Y = \"NEA_1\", Z = \"CHIMP_1\", mode = \"branch\")\n)\n\nBind each list of data frames into a single data frame:\n\nf4_afr &lt;- do.call(rbind, f4_afr_list)\nf4_eur &lt;- do.call(rbind, f4_eur_list)\n\n# add population columns to each of the two results for easier plotting\nf4_afr$pop &lt;- \"AFR\"\nf4_eur$pop &lt;- \"EUR\"\n\n# bind both tables together\nf4_results &lt;- rbind(f4_afr, f4_eur)\n\nNow we can visualize the results:\n\nf4_results %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(pop, f4, color = pop)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"f4(AFR, EUR; NEA, CHIMP)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the \\(f_4\\) statistic test of Neanderthal introgression in Europeans indeed does give a much more negative distribution of values compared to the baseline expectation which compares two Africans to each other.",

    "text": "Part 1: A self-contained slendr function of \\(N_e \\rightarrow \\textrm{AFS}\\)\nSo far we’ve learned how slendr provides an easy way to define demographic models in R and simulate (even very large!) tree sequences from them. This allows us to quickly verify our intuition about some popgen problem (things like “Hmmm, I wonder what would an \\(f_4\\) statistic look like if my model includes this particular gene-flow event?), in just a few lines of R. There have been instances in which we’ve been able to even answer questions like this directly in a meeting, pretty much on the spot! This makes slendr a very powerful “popgen calculator”.\nNow let’s take things one step further. Imagine you gathered some empirical data, like an allele frequency spectrum (AFS) from a population that you study. That data was, in the real world, produced by some (hidden) biological process (demographic history) that we want to learn about. For instance, the population we study had some \\(N_e\\), which we don’t know the value of (the only thing we have is the observed AFS) but we want to infer that value.\nSimulations can be a great tool to estimate the most likely value of such an unknown parameter. Briefly speaking, in this particular toy example, we can simulate a large number of AFS vectors (each resulting from a different assumed \\(N_e\\) value) and then pick just those \\(N_e\\) values (or just one \\(N_e\\) value) which produced a simulated AFS closest to the observed AFS.\nThis is exactly what you’ll be doing just now in Exercise 3.\nIn a new script afs.R write a custom R function called simulate_afs(), which will take Ne as its only parameter. Use this function to compute (and return) AFS vectors for a couple of Ne values of your choosing, but staying between Ne = 1000 and Ne = 30000 Plot those AFS vectors and observe how (and why?) do they differ based on Ne parameter you used in each respective simulation.\nHint: The function should create a one-population forward-time model (our population starting at time = 1, with the model simulation_length = 100000 and generation_time = 1 in compile_model()), simulate 10Mb tree sequence using msprime() (recombination rate 1e-8) and then overlay neutral mutations on it at mutation_rate = 1e-8), compute AFS for 10 samples and return the AFS vector as result of this custom function.\nHint: If you’ve never programmed before, the concept of a “custom function” might be very alien to you. Again, if you need help, feel free to start building your afs.R solution based on this “template” (just fill in missing relevant bits of slendr code that you should be already familiar with):\nlibrary(slendr)\ninit_env()\n\nsimulate_afs &lt;- function(Ne) {\n  # In here you should write code which will:\n  #   1. create one population with a given Ne (provided as a function argument)\n  #   2. compile a model using `simulation_length =` and `generation_time =`\n  #   3. simulate a tree sequence\n  #   4. select names of 10 samples (doesn't matter which, \"pop_1\", \"po2_\", ...)\n  #   5. compute AFS vector from those 10 individuals using `ts_afs()`\n  \n  # `result` is a variable with your 10-sample AFS vector (we remove the\n  # first element because it's not meaningful for our example)\n  return(result[-1]) \n}\n\nafs_1 &lt;- simulate_afs(Ne = 1000) # simulate AFS from a Ne = 1000 model...\nplot(afs_1, type =\"o\")           # ... and plot it\nHint: If the above still doesn’t make any sense to you, feel free to copy-paste the function from the solution below into your script and work with that function instead!\nWhen used in R, your custom function should work like this (the simulation is stochastic, so your numbers will be different, of course):\n# This gives us a vector of singletons, doubletons, etc., etc., all the way\n# to the number of fixed mutations in our sample of 10 individuals\nsimulate_afs(Ne = 1000)\n\n [1] 397 185 111  94  77  69  77  51  58  53  34  32  48  17  23  30  12  26  28\n[20]  23",

Hopefully you now also see how easy slendr makes it to do this (normally a rather laborious) process.\nThis kind of approach can be used to infer all sorts of demographic parameters, even using other summary statistics that you’ve also learned to compute… including selection parameters, which we delve into in another exercise.",

As an example, take a look at Figure 5 in the paper, demonstrating that an Indian population can be arbitrarily placed in proximity to Europeans, East Asians, and Africans, simply by wiggling the sample sizes of all groups before they applying PCA on their genotype data.\nThis activity session is not a place to debate the merit of PCA (or any other popgen method for that matter). What we can do (as we’ve done in previous exercises) is to show how slendr can be used in a very easy way to evaluate patterns, expected behavior, and overall dynamics of many popgen metrics in a controlled settings – and in this way, verify our intuition and check the robustness of a method in question – using PCA as another example. We’ll be specifically looking at patterns which arise in PCA depending on the exact spatio-temporal sampling from a demographic model.\nStart a new script named exercise5.R with the following setup of another toy demographic model:\nlibrary(slendr)\ninit_env(quiet = TRUE)\n\nsource(here::here(\"files/popgen/popgen_utils.R\"))\n\npopA &lt;- population(\"popA\", time = 3000, N = 5000)\npopB &lt;- population(\"popB\", time = 1500, N = 5000, parent = popA)\npopC &lt;- population(\"popC\", time = 1500, N = 5000, parent = popA)\n\nmodel &lt;- compile_model(list(popA, popB, popC), generation_time = 1)\n\nschedule &lt;- schedule_sampling(model, times = seq(3000, 0, by = -200),\n                              list(popA, 10), list(popB, 10), list(popC, 10))\n\nplot_model(model, proportions = TRUE, samples = schedule)\nAs you can see, this model describes the demographic history of three populations: one ancestral population “popA” starting at 3000 generations ago, which splits into two populations “popB” and “popC” the same time at 1500 generations ago.

    "text": "Part 2: Simulate a (mutated!) tree sequence\nTo be able to run PCA using the smartsnp R package (below), we will need to simulate data in the EIGENSTRAT file format. And to do that, we need our tree sequence with mutations.\nRecall that all of our previous exercises managed to do away with mutations completely, owing to the amazing nature of the succint tree sequence data structure invented by the people behind the tskit project. However, all traditional popgen software and tools still rely on genotype data, which is why we now have to simulate mutations as well. Luckily, this is very easy – instead of the traditional\n\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = ..., recombination_rate = ..., samples = ...)\n\nwe will run this:\n\n# First run a normal msprime simulation creating a tree-sequence object, then\n# directly pipe it into a function which adds (neutral!) mutations to it\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = ..., recombination_rate = ..., samples = ...) %&gt;%\n  ts_mutate(mutation_rate = ...)\n\nwhich is equivalent to running this without the %&gt;% “pipe operator”:\n\n# First run a normal msprime simulation creating a tree-sequence object...\nts_nomuts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = ..., recombination_rate = ..., samples = ...)\n# ... then add (neutral!) mutations to it\nts &lt;- ts_mutate(ts_nomuts, mutation_rate = ...)\n\nWith that out of the way, simulate a tree sequence from the popA/popB/popC model above, which will be 50 Mb (50e6) long, with a recombination rate 1e-8, and overlay mutations on it at a rate 1e-8. Check that it has mutations either by typing out ts in the console and looking for a “Mutations” section of the summary, or by using the function ts_table(ts, \"mutations\"). Then count how many individuals you have recorded for each population using the table produced by ts_samples().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# First run a normal msprime simulation creating a tree-sequence object, then\n# directly pipe it into a function which adds (neutral!) mutations to it\nts_nomuts &lt;- msprime(model, samples = schedule, sequence_length = 50e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, random_seed = 1702182272)\n\n# Notice we have no mutations on the tree sequence, just as before...\nts_nomuts\n\n╔═══════════════════════════╗\n║TreeSequence               ║\n╠═══════════════╤═══════════╣\n║Trees          │    160,114║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Sequence Length│ 50,000,000║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Time Units     │generations║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Sample Nodes   │        620║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Total Size     │   26.1 MiB║\n╚═══════════════╧═══════════╝\n╔═══════════╤═══════╤═════════╤════════════╗\n║Table      │Rows   │Size     │Has Metadata║\n╠═══════════╪═══════╪═════════╪════════════╣\n║Edges      │619,886│ 18.9 MiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Individuals│    310│  8.5 KiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Migrations │      0│  8 Bytes│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Mutations  │      0│ 16 Bytes│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Nodes      │ 92,209│  2.5 MiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Populations│      3│303 Bytes│         Yes║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Provenances│      1│  5.2 KiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Sites      │      0│ 16 Bytes│          No║\n╚═══════════╧═══════╧═════════╧════════════╝\n\nts &lt;- ts_mutate(ts_nomuts, mutation_rate = 1e-8)\n\n# ... but we have them now!\nts\n\n╔═══════════════════════════╗\n║TreeSequence               ║\n╠═══════════════╤═══════════╣\n║Trees          │    160,114║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Sequence Length│ 50,000,000║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Time Units     │generations║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Sample Nodes   │        620║\n╟───────────────┼───────────╢\n║Total Size     │   36.1 MiB║\n╚═══════════════╧═══════════╝\n╔═══════════╤═══════╤═════════╤════════════╗\n║Table      │Rows   │Size     │Has Metadata║\n╠═══════════╪═══════╪═════════╪════════════╣\n║Edges      │619,886│ 18.9 MiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Individuals│    310│  8.5 KiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Migrations │      0│  8 Bytes│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Mutations  │168,690│  6.0 MiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Nodes      │ 92,209│  2.5 MiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Populations│      3│303 Bytes│         Yes║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Provenances│      2│  6.0 KiB│          No║\n╟───────────┼───────┼─────────┼────────────╢\n║Sites      │168,420│  4.0 MiB│          No║\n╚═══════════╧═══════╧═════════╧════════════╝\n\n# Get the table of individuals (and process it a bit for tidier plotting later)\nsamples &lt;- ts_samples(ts) %&gt;% mutate(pop = factor(pop, levels = c(\"popA\", \"popB\", \"popC\")))\n\n# Count how many individuals do we have for each population\nsamples %&gt;% group_by(pop) %&gt;% count()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n# Groups:   pop [3]\n  pop       n\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 popA    150\n2 popB     80\n3 popC     80",

    "text": "Part 5: Principal Component Analysis on the entire simulated data set\nNow, at long last, we have everything we need to be able to run ABC on the data generated by our slendr model. To avoid making this exercise even longer, I provided a helper function for you called plot_pca(). But this function isn’t doing anything magical – it uses the smartsnp R package to compute the principal components and visualize the results using ggplot2. This is something many of you could do given enough time but we want to focus on simulations and PCA, not pure R coding. If you’re interested, take a look at my implementation of plot_pca() here.\nHere’s how you can use this function (remeber that you need to put source(here::here(\"files/popgen/popgen_utils.R\")) into your script!):\n\nPlot PCA while coloring each individual by their population assignment:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"pop\")\n\n\nPlot PCA while coloring each individual by their time of sampling:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"time\")\n\n\nBy default, the function plots PC 1 vs PC 2, but you can customize things by providing an optional argument pc = like this:\n\n\nplot_pca(\"path/to/prefix\", &lt;tree sequence used to create EIGENSTRAT&gt;, color_by = \"pop\", pc = c(2, 3))\n\nUse the provided plot_pca() function to run PCA based on genotypes for all recorded individuals that you just converted as EIGENSTRAT \"files/popgen/ABC_all\" from the ts tree sequence. Visualize PC 1 vs PC 2 by first ccolor each individual by their population label (color_by = \"pop\") then by the time of their sampling (color_by = \"time\").\nDoes the PCA of PC 1 vs PC 2 capture the relationship between all individuals across the populations and across time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_pca(\"files/popgen/ABC_all\", ts, color_by = \"pop\", pc = c(1, 2))\n\nPCA cache for the given EIGENSTRAT data was not found.

Which pair of PCs does the best job at recapitulating the demographic model?\n\n\nNote: We’re doing this purely for educational purposes and for fun, using an extremely idealistic demographic model which is perfectly known (by definition, because we simulated it) and perfect sampling scheme.

In order to do that, we need to be able to select only a defined subset of individuals from a given tree sequence. Which brings us to the last tree-sequence processing function in slendr callsed ts_simplify(). Implemented on top of the simplify() method in tskit, it has a very simple interface:\n\nts_small &lt;- ts_simplify(ts_big, simplify_to = c(&lt;subset of individuals as a vector&gt;))\n\nThis function call creates a new tree sequence, which is smaller and only contains a those individuals whose names were specified in simplify_to = (again, we’re talking about the “symbolic names” of individuals, such as “NEA_1”, “AFR_42”, etc., not integer numbers of tskit nodes).\nWhenever you want to create smaller subsets of a large tree sequence, it is often helpful to work with the table of all individuals in the original tree sequence, because it contains every individual’s name, pop assignment and the time in which it lived, so let’s save it for further use now:\n\nsamples &lt;- ts_samples(ts)\n\nnrow(samples)\n\n[1] 310\n\n\nFor instance, we can get only individuals from “popB” and “popC” sampled at the present using this code:\n\nsubset &lt;- filter(samples, pop %in% c(\"popB\", \"popC\"), time == 0)\n\nnrow(subset)\n\n[1] 20\n\n\nYou know that the table of samples contains the name of each individual, which you can access as subset$name. Use the ts_simplify() function to create a new tree sequence called ts_BC0 which contains only this subset of individuals. Check that it really does contain only the defined subset of individuals using ts_samples(ts_BC0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nts_BC0 &lt;- ts_simplify(ts, simplify_to = subset$name)\n\nts_samples(ts_BC0)\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   name     time pop  \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 popB_71     0 popB \n 2 popB_72     0 popB \n 3 popB_73     0 popB \n 4 popB_74     0 popB \n 5 popB_75     0 popB \n 6 popB_76     0 popB \n 7 popB_77     0 popB \n 8 popB_78     0 popB \n 9 popB_79     0 popB \n10 popB_80     0 popB \n11 popC_71     0 popC \n12 popC_72     0 popC \n13 popC_73     0 popC \n14 popC_74     0 popC \n15 popC_75     0 popC \n16 popC_76     0 popC \n17 popC_77     0 popC \n18 popC_78     0 popC \n19 popC_79     0 popC \n20 popC_80     0 popC \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have a smaller tree sequence like this, you can convert it to an EIGENSTRAT file format using ts_eigenstrat() just like we did above.\n\n\nPart 2: PCA visualization on subsets of individuals\nTODO: Try to replicate some features of the results discovered for EUR/ASIAN/AFR/Indian populations.",

    "text": "Part 1: Simulating a tree sequence and computing Tajima’s D\nNote: Unfortunately, the most recent SLiM v4.3 is a little broken, largely sabotaging the second half of this exercise in which slendr uses SLiM for non-neutral simulations. That said, the first half of the exercise works perfectly fine and, once SLiM v5.0 comes out (soon), everything from the first half will apply to the selection simulations. Alternatively, if you have the option, use SLiM 4.2.x.\nThe primary motivation for designing slendr was to make demographic modelling in R as trivially easy and fast as possible, focusing exclusively on neutral models. However, as slendr became popular, people have been asking for the possibility of simulating natural selection. After all, a large part of slendr’s functionality deals with population genetic models across geographical landscapes, which requires SLiM. So why not support selection simulations using slendr as well?\nIn December 2024 I caved in and added support for modifying slendr demographic models with bits of SLiM code, which allows simulating pretty much any arbitrary selection scenario you might be interested in.\nThis exercise is a quick demonstration of how this works and how you might simulate selection using slendr. We will do this using another toy model of ancient human history, which we will first use as a basis for simulating the frequency trajectory of an allele under positive selection, and then implementing a toy selection scan using Tajima’s D.\nTo speed things up, create a new selection.R script and copy the following code as a starting point for this exercise:\nNext, visualize the demographic model. If you did a bit of work in human population genetics, you might recognize it as a very simplified model of demographic history of Europe over the past 50 thousand years or so. As you can see, we are recording 50 individuals from four populations – for Europeans we sample 50 individuals at “present-day”, for the remaining populations we’re recording 50 individuals just before their disappearance. Also note that there’s quite a bit of gene-flow! This was an important thing we’ve learned about human history in the past 10 years or so – everyone is mixed with pretty much everyone, there isn’t (and never was) anything as a “pure population”.\nAlthough the point of this exercise is to simulate selection, let’s first simulate a normal neutral model using slendr’s msprime() engine as a sanity check. Simulate 10 Mb of sequence with a recombination rate 1e-8 and a sampling schedule defined above. Let’s not worry about adding any mutations, just to change things up a little bit. We’ll be working with branch-based statistics here (which means adding mode = \"branch\" whenever we will be computing a statistic, such as Tajima’s D).\nInspect the table of all individuals recorded in our tree sequence using the function ts_samples(), making sure we have all the individuals scheduled for tree-sequence recording. (Again, there’s no such a thing as too many sanity checks when doing research!)\nAs you’ve already learned in an earlier exercise, tskit functions in slendr generally operate on vectors (or lists) of individual names, like those produced by ts_names() above. Get a vector of names of individuals in every population recorded in the tree sequence, then use this to compute Tajima’s D using the slendr function ts_tajima(). (Use the same approach as you have with ts_diversity() or ts_divergence() above, using the list of names of individuals as the sample_sets = argument for ts_tajima()). Do you see any striking differences in the Tajima’s D values across populations? Check this for some general guidance.",

    "text": "Part 2: Computing Tajima’s D in windows\nLet’s take this one step forward. Even if there is a locus under positive selection somewhere along our chromosome, it might be quite unlikely that we would find a Tajima’s D value significant enough for the entire chromosome (which is basically what we did in Part 1 now). Fortunately, thanks to the flexibility of the tskit module, the slendr function ts_tajima() has an argument windows =, which allows us to specify the coordinates of windows into which a sequence should be broken into, with Tajima’s D computed separately for each window. Perhaps this will allow us to see the impact of positive selection after we get to adding selection to our model. So let’s first built some code towards that.\nDefine a variable windows which will contain a vector of coordinates of 100 windows, starting at position 0, and ending at position 10e6 (i.e., the end of our chromosome). Then provide this variable as the windows = argument of ts_tajima() on a new, separate line of your script. Save the result of ts_tajima() into the variable tajima_wins, and inspect its contents in the R console.\nHint: You can use the R function seq() and its argument length.out = 100, to create the coordinates of window boundaries very easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pre-compute genomic windows for window-based computation of Tajima's D\nwindows &lt;- round(seq(0, ts$sequence_length, length.out = 100))\nwindows\n\n# Compute genome-wide Tajima's D for each population in individual windows\ntajima_wins &lt;- ts_tajima(ts, sample_sets = samples, windows = windows, mode = \"branch\")\ntajima_wins\n\n# You can see that the format of the result is slightly strange, with the\n# `D` column containing a vector of numbers (this is done for conciseness)\ntajima_wins[1, ]$D\n\n\n\n\nThe default output format of ts_tajima() is not super user-friendly. Process the result using a helper function process_tajima(tajima_wins) that I provided for you (perhaps save it as tajima_df), and visualize it using another of my helper functions plot_tajima(tajima_df).\n\n\nNote: Making the process_tajima() and plot_tajima() function available in your R code is the purpose of the source(here::here(\"files/popgen/popgen_utils.R\")) command at the beginning of your script for this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The helper function `process_tajima()` reformats the results into a normal\n# data frame, this time with a new column `window` which indicates the index\n# of the window that each `D` value was computed in\ntajima_df &lt;- process_tajima(tajima_wins)\ntajima_df\n\n# Now let's visualize the window-based Tajima's D along the simulated genome\n# using another helper function `plot_tajima()`\nplot_tajima(tajima_df)\n\nIt’s no surprise that we don’t see any Tajima’s D outliers in any of our windows, because we’re still working with a tree sequence produced by our a purely neutral simulation.

    "text": "Part 3: Adding positive selection to the base demographic model\nAlthough primarily designed for neutral demographic models, slendr allows optional simulation of natural selection by providing a “SLiM extension code snippet” with customization SLiM code as an optional argument extension = of compile_model() (a function you’re closely familiar with at this point).\nUnfortunately we don’t have any space to explain SLiM here (and I have no idea, at the time of writing, whether or not you will have worked with SLiM earlier in this workshop). Suffice to say that SLiM is another very popular population genetic simulator software which allows simulation of selection, and which requires you to write custom code in a different programming language called Eidos.\nTake a look at the file slim_extension.txt provided in your working directory (it’s also part of the GitHub repository here). If you worked with SLiM before, glance through the script casually and see if it makes any sense to you. If you have not worked with SLiM before, look for the strange {elements} in curly brackets in the first ten lines of the script. Those are the parameters of the selection model we will be customizing the standard neutral demographic model we started with in the next step.\nSpecifically, when you inspect the slim_extension.txt file, you can see that this “SLiM extension script” I provided for you has three parameters:\n\norigin_pop – in which population should a beneficial allele appear,\ns – what should be the selection coefficient of the beneficial allele, and\nonset_time – at which time should the allele appear in the origin_pop.\n\nHowever, at the start, the SLiM extension snippet doesn’t contain any concrete values of those parameters, but only their {origin_pop}, {s}, and {onset_time} placeholders.\nUse the slendr function substitute_values() to substitute concrete values for those parameters like this:\n\nextension &lt;- substitute_values(\n  template = here::here(\"files/popgen/slim_extension.txt\"),\n  origin_pop = \"EUR\",\n  s = 0.15,\n  onset_time = 12000\n)\nextension\n\nYou can see that substitute_values() returned a path to a file. Take a look at that file in your terminal – you should see each of the three {placeholder} parameters replaced with a concrete given value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the first 15 lines of the extension file before and after calling substitute_values(). We’ll do this in R for simplicity, but you can use less in plain unix terminal.\nBefore – see the {{placeholder}} parameters in their original form:\nAfter – see the {{placeholder}} parameters with concrete values!\n\n\n\nAnd that’s all the extra work we need to turn our purely neutral demographic slendr model into a model which includes natural selection! (In this case, only a simple selection acting on a single locus, as you’ll see later, but this can be generalized to any imaginable selection scenario.)\nHow do we use the SLiM extension for our simulation? It’s very simple – we just have to provide the extension variable as an additional argument of good old compile_model(). This will compile a new slendr model which will now include the new functionality for simulating natural selection:\nCompile a new model of the history of populations afr, ooa, ehg, etc., by following the instructions above, providing a new extension = argument to the compile_model() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- compile_model(\n  populations = list(afr, ooa, ehg, eur, ana, yam),\n  gene_flow = gf, generation_time = 30,\n  extension = extension   # &lt;======== this is missing in the neutral example!\n)",

The latter can still interpret the same demographic model we programmed in R, just like the msprime() engine can, but will run the model using SLiM (and thus leveraging the new SLiM extension code that we have customized using substitute_values() above). We simply do this by switching from this:\n\n\nts &lt;- msprime(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, samples = schedule)\n\nto this:\n\nts &lt;- slim(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8, samples = schedule)\n\nAs you can see, you don’t have to modify anything in your model code, just switching from msprime to slim in the line of code which produces the simulation result.\n\nThe customized model will not only produce a tree sequence, but will also generate a table of allele frequencies in each population (SLiM experts might have noticed the revelant SLiM code when they were inspecting slim_extension.txt). We need to be able to load both of these files after the simulation and thus need a path to a location we can find those files. We can do this by calling the slim() function as path &lt;- slim(..., path = TRUE) (so with the extra path = argument). This will return a path to where the slim() engine saved all files with our desired results.\n\nRun a simulation from the modified model of selection with the slim() engine as instructed in points number 1. and 2. above, then use the list.files(path) function in R to take a look in the directory.

    "section": "Part 6: Tajima’s D (genome-wide and window-based) from the selection model",
    "text": "Part 6: Tajima’s D (genome-wide and window-based) from the selection model\nRecall that your simulation run saved results in the location stored in the path variable:\n\nlist.files(path)\n\nFrom this path, we’ve already successfuly investigated the frequency trajectories.\nNow let’s compute Tajima’s D on the tree sequence simulated from our selection model. Hopefully we should see an interesting pattern in our selection scan? For instance, we don’t know yet where in the genome is the putative locus under selection!\nTo read a tree sequence simulated with slim() by our customized selection setup, we need to do a bit of work. To simplify things a bit, here’s the R code which makes it possible to do. Just copy it in your selection.R script as it is:\n\n# Let's use my own saved simulation results, so that we're all on the\n# same page going forward\npath &lt;- here::here(\"files/popgen/selection\")\n\nts &lt;-\n  file.path(path, \"slim.trees\") %&gt;%  # 1. compose full path to the slim.trees file\n  ts_read(model) %&gt;%                 # 2. read the tree sequence file into R\n  ts_recapitate(Ne = 5000, recombination_rate = 1e-8) # 3. perform recapitation\n\nVery briefly, because our tree sequence was generated by SLiM, it’s very likely that not all genealogies along the simulated genome will be fully coalesced (i.e., not all tree will have a single root). To explain why this is the case is out of the scope of this session, but read here if you’re interested in learning more. For the time being, it suffices to say that we can pass the (uncoalesced) tree sequence into the ts_recapitate() function, which then takes a SLiM tree sequence and simulates all necessary “ancestral history” that was missing on the uncoalesced trees, thus ensuring that the entire tree sequence is fully coalesced and can be correctly computed on.\nNow that you have a ts tree sequence object resulting from a new selection simulation run, repeat the analyses of genome-wide and window-based Tajima’s D from Part 1 and Part 2 of this exercise, again using the provided helper functions process_tajima() and plot_tajima(). Can you identify which locus has been the likely focal point of the positive selection? Which population shows evidence of selection? Which doesn’t and why (look again at the visualization of the demographic model above)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamples &lt;- ts_names(ts, split = \"pop\")\nsamples\n\n# Overall Tajima's D across the 10Mb sequence still doesn't reveal any significant\n# deviations even in case of selection (again, not entirely unsurprising)\nts_tajima(ts, sample_sets = samples, mode = \"branch\")\n\n\n# So let's look at the window-based computation again...\nwindows &lt;- as.integer(seq(0, ts$sequence_length, length.out = 100))\n\n# compute genome-wide Tajima's D for each population in individual windows\ntajima_wins &lt;- ts_tajima(ts, sample_sets = samples, windows = windows, mode = \"branch\")\ntajima_df &lt;- process_tajima(tajima_wins)\n\nplot_tajima(tajima_df)\n\nYou should see a clear dip in Tajima’s D around the midpoint of the DNA sequence, but only in Europeans. The beneficial allele appeared in the European population, and although the plot of the allele frequency trajectories shows that the selection dynamics has been dramatically affected by gene-flow events (generally causing a repeated “dilution” of the selection signal in Europeans), there has never been gene-flow (at least in our model) from Europeans to other populations, so the beneficial allele never had a chance to “make it” into those populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercises\n\n\n\n\nBonus 1: Examine the pattern of ancestry tracts along the simulated genome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# tracts &lt;- ts_tracts(ts, source = \"ANA\", target = \"EUR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus 2: Investigate the impact of recombination around the selected locus\nVary the uniform recombination rate and observe what happens with Tajima’s D in windows along the genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: just modify the value of the recombination_rate = argument provided to the slim() function above.\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus 3: Simulate origin of the allele in EHG\nSimulate the origin of the beneficial allele in the EHG population – what do the trajectories look like now? How does that change the Tajima’s D distribution along the genome in our European populations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this extension in the slim() call, and repeat the rest of the selection-based workflow in this exercise.\n\nextension &lt;- substitute_values(\n  template = here::here(\"files/popgen/slim_extension.txt\"),\n  origin_pop = \"EHG\",\n  s = 0.1,\n  onset_time = 12000\n)\n\nmodel &lt;- compile_model(\n  populations = list(afr, ooa, ehg, eur, ana, yam),\n  gene_flow = gf, generation_time = 30,\n  extension = extension\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus 4: Other statistics in windows\nAs a practice of your newly acquired tree-sequence computation skills with slendr, calculate some other statistics in the same windows along the simulated genome, visualize them yourself, and compare the results to the window-based Tajima’s D pattern. For instance, ts_diversity(), ts_divergence(), or ts_segregating() might be quite interesting to look at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the same tree sequence file you’ve computed Tajima’s D on, and then apply the functions ts_diversity(), ts_divergence(), and ts_segregating() on that tree sequence.",

    "text": "Part XYZ: Building a command-line script\nIn the previous chapter, you generalized an R script for simulating genetic drift into a dedicated function. In this way, you have taken an important step towards reproducibility of your code. In situations in which you need to run a number of simulations for a (potentially very large) set of parameter combinations, a naive approach would’ve been to copy-paste bits of code, one copy for one batch of simulations. This would work, but it would be very annoying and boring to do, and it would be significantly error-prone.\nFinding a mistake in a very long R script which contains repeated copies of very similar bits of code is a disaster. Instead of this repetition, you can now have all the logic of your simulation in one single place (a function) and reduce the repetition to only calling the function with specific parameter values as needed. In fact, you later went even one step further, and reduced even that repetition to calling a single for loop!",
