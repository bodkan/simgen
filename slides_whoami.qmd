<h2>
Data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility for population genetics in R</h2>
</h2>
<h3>--- An interactive workshop</h3>
<br>
<h4>13-17 October 2025, Tartu, Estonia</h4>
</center>

#

<center><h1>Why does this workshop even exist?</h1></center>

<br>

<center>Why am I stressing "programming", "automation", and
"fundamentals" so much in selling this workshop?</center>

<br>

<center>What format does the workshop have and<br>how can _we_ take the most out of it?</center>

#

<center><h1>Every field of science today is computational</h1></center>

<br>
<center>Some less, some (much) more.<br>(such as genomics)</center>

#

<center><h3>It was possible to do cutting-edge science without much programming
10-15 years ago.</h3></center>

. . .

<br>
<center>"In the good old days" you could easily be at the top of your field with
nothing but Microsoft Excel. Not now.</center>

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>Education has been catching up, but not as quickly as it could
(and should).
</h3></center>

## The ECHO team said something very profound during early discussions


> _"When new a student starts their Master's/PhD degree, they're usually
thrown into a pond because their supervisor doesn't guide them through all
the basic computational competencies that they should learn."_

. . .

Maybe they don't have time.<br>
Maybe it's expected students will pick things up along the way.<br>
Maybe they don't realize that those skills are important...<br>
<p align="right">(... because getting results is the primary focus.)</p>

. . .

<center><h3>This isn't just a university education problem.</h3></center>

## We are in a "reproducibility crisis"

#

<center><h1>This has many reasons</h1></center>

. . .

<br><center>"Publish or perish."</center>

<br><center>Competitiveness rewarding "fast" over "careful".</center>

<br><center>Science became much bigger much faster
before modern, user-friendly methods were developed.</center>

<br><center>**It's still very rare for scientists to publish their code!**</center>

# Why even do science?

<p align="right">After all, it's about finding the truth about the world.</p>

<br>

. . .

<center><h2>We should strive to do better.</h2></center>

<p align="right">_Especially_ as junior researchers, all of us.</p>

#

<center><h1>Counterpoint</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3>Is perfectly reproducible science automatically reliable and more 
trustworthy?</h3></center>


#

<center><h1>Automatically reliable?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>Definitely not.</u><br><br>

Research can still be wrong (even in subtle ways),
and still be perfectly reproducible in beautiful clean code.</h3></center>



#

<center><h1>More trustworthy?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>Most definitely.</u><br><br>
Having access to fully reproducible scripts and
pipelines is the only way to discover and fix errors, and build towards better research.
</h3></center>


#

<center><h2>The alternative to not publishing reproducible code and workflows
is the equivalent of not publishing proper laboratory protocols.</h2></center>

. . .

<br>

<center>**Materials and Methods**:<br> _"We ran a couple of PCRs on a few drops
from each extract."_</center>




## Reproducibility is a very wide concept

<center>**Often it's _you_ yourself who must reproduce your project!**
<br>(And it often happens under stressful circumstances.)</center>

#

<center><h1>Every field of science today is computational</h1></center>

. . .

<br>
<center>Which is why trustworthy science requires building a solid basis in
computer programming and learning the best available techniques for
computational research.</center>

. . .

<center><h3><br>This workshop hopes to provide the opportunity to do exactly that.
</h3>(Focusing on reproducible R workflows as a general example.)</h3></center>

<h1>Wow this guy sure likes to talk a lot.</h1>

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

. . .

- I really like programming computers
  - I've been privileged to do it since I was a small kid
  - (Yes, I school I was one of those weird, unpopular nerds)

. . .

- I did BSc. in Computer Science after high school

. . .

- I decided I don't want to work in an IT company

. . .

- I loved physiology/immunology topics in House MD TV series

. . .

- To the horror of my mom, I did _another_ BSc. (Biochemistry)

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

- I did MSc in Cell Biology, but I sucked at lab work (badly)

. . .

- ... and I started missing programming again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

. . . 

- I applied for PhD at Max Planck Institute in Leipzig to study
aDNA of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and ancient humans

. . .

- Years of bioinformatics, data science, and statistics made me aware
of the barriers to reliable computational biology

- As an outsider (computer scientist) and an insider (a biologist), I have
a unique insight into both worlds

## Writing R has been my job for 10 years

<br>

1. _admixr_ ([bodkan.net/admixr](https://bodkan.net/admixr)) --- $f$-statistics
R package
2. _slendr_ ([bodkan.net/slendr](https://bodkan.net/slendr)) --- popgen simulations
R package
2. _demografr_ ([bodkan.net/demografr](https://bodkan.net/demografr)) --- R package
for simulation-based demographic inference (like ABC)

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>I design all my software (obsessively) to allow easy and
reproducible research for _everyone_.</h3></center>

#

<center>

<h1>Fun fact:</h1>

<h2>At the beginning I actually hated R!</h2>

</center>

. . .

<br>

<center>
I became a convert after seeing my experienced colleagues use it to do
amazing science (and create beautiful _ggplot2_ figures), and learning about
"modern data science movement" in R.
</center>

. . .

<br>
<center>**This workshop is a little bit like that:**<br>
_"The best of modern R for reproducible data science."_</center>

# 

<center><h1>The challenge of teaching a course on</h1></center>
<br>
<center><font size=20>_"The best of modern R for<br>reproducible data science"_</font></center>
<br>
<center><h2>is that our expectations and prior experiences are totally different.</h2></center>

<h1>None of this is possible!</h1>
</center>

<center>
<br>
<h2>So how do we deal with this?</h2>
</center>


## This is a workshop, not lecture series

- Lectures would be guaranteed to be boring for some of you
  - (regardless of that arbitrarily set "expected competence")

. . .

- Be as practical as possible --- "practical" in both:
  1. focusing exclusively on "hands-on exercises"
  2. giving you the chance to work on your own projects (hopefully integrating
  bits and pieces of the exercises)

. . .

- Comfortable space to do 1. and/or 2. <u>on your own pace</u>

. . .

<center><h2>What form could this take for you?</h2></center>

<center><h1>Target audiences</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3>Tips on getting the most out of this course depending on your level.</h3></center>

## If you already know a lot about R

- Please talk to me! Let's solve coding challenges together. Other people
who need to learn more will have a lot of material to work through on their
own pace.

- During most of my courses, people are coding and are completely absorbed by
their work... and I sit there quiet, reading a book. :)

## Outline of this workshop

<center>![](files/whoami/structure2.png)</center>

<center>The main "exercise" should always be to ask yourself:<br>
**_"How can I apply (some of) this material<br>to make (some of) my work better?"_**</center>

## Our time schedule

- 10:00-12:00 Morning session
- 12:00-14:00 Lunch break
- 14:00-16/17:00 Afternoon session (depends on each day)

It's impossible to map each "topic" to specific time slot.

We'll play it by the ear.

# What about ChatGPT?

. . .

If the previous slides were too philosophical for you, don't even get me started on "AI"...

. . .

<br>

<p align="right">... I used "AI" a lot in the first two years (like all programmers).</p>

. . .

<p align="right">... then I learned of the drastic ethical consequences of "AI".<br></p>

. . .

<p align="right">... I kept reading studies showing how "AI" makes us dumber.</p>

. . .

<br>

<center><h3>The bottom line seems to be:</h3>

<u>If</u> "AI" is useful, it's for people who are already experts.</center>
