# Data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility for population genetics in R

#

<center>Why does this workshop even exist?</center>

. . .

<br>

Why am I stressing "programming", "reproducibility", "automation", and
"fundamentals" so much in advertising this workshop?

# Science today relies computation

## The ECHO team said something very important during our early discussions


> _"When new students start their Master's/PhD degree, they're usually
thrown into a pond because their supervisor doesn't have time to
guide them through all the basic computational skills they should learn."_

. . .

Maybe they don't have time.
Maybe it's expected students will pick things up along the way.
Maybe they themselves don't realize those skills are important.

. . .

(Many PIs are "just focused on the results".)

## We are in a "reproducibility crisis"

# Why even do science?

<center>(It should be about finding the truth about the world.)</center>

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

. . .

- I really like programming computers
  - I've been privileged to do it since I was a small kid
  - (Yes I was one of those "weird unpopular children")

. . .

- I did BSc. in Computer Science after high school

. . .

- I decided I don't want to work in an IT corporation.

. . .

- I loved physiology/immunology topics in House MD TV series

. . .

- To the horror of my mom, I did _another_ BSc. (Biochemistry)

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

- I then did MSc in Cell Biology I realized I suck at lab work

. . .

- ... and I started missing programming again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<h2>At the beginning I actually hated R!</h2>

</center>

. . .

<br>

But after seeing my colleagues used it to do amazing science (and beautiful
_ggplot2_ figures), I invested time into learning it.

<h2>I've been an R programming scientist for 10 years</h2>
