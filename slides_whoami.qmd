# Data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility for population genetics in R

# Why does this workshop even exist?

. . .

<br>

Why am I stressing "programming", "reproducibility", "automation", and
"fundamentals" so much in advertising this workshop?

# Science today relies computation

## The ECHO team said something very important during our early discussions


> _"When new students start their Master's/PhD degree, they're usually
thrown into a pond because their supervisor doesn't have time to
guide them through all the basic computational skills they should learn."_

. . .

Maybe they don't have time.
Maybe it's expected students will pick things up along the way.
Maybe they themselves don't realize those skills are important.

. . .

(Many PIs are "just focused on the results".)

## We are in a "reproducibility crisis"
