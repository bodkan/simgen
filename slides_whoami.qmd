<h2>
A workshop on data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility for population genetics in R</h2>
</h2>
<br>
<h4>13-17 October 2025, Tartu, Estonia</h4>
</center>

#

<center><h1>Why does this workshop even exist?</h1></center>

<br>

<center>Why am I stressing "programming", "automation", and
"fundamentals" so much in selling this workshop?</center>

<br>

<center>What format does the workshop have and<br>how can _we_ take the most out of it?</center>

#

<center><h1>Every field of science today is computational</h1></center>

<br>
<center>Some less, some (much) more.<br>(such as genomics)</center>

#

<center><h3>It was possible to do cutting-edge science without much programming
10-15 years ago.</h3></center>

. . .

<br>
<center>"In the good old days" you could easily be at the top of your field with
nothing but Microsoft Excel. Not now.</center>

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>Education has been catching up, but not as quickly as it could
(and should).
</h3></center>

## The ECHO team said something very profound during early discussions


> _"When new a student starts their Master's/PhD degree, they're usually
thrown into a pond because their supervisor doesn't guide them through all
the basic computational competencies that they should learn."_

. . .

Maybe they don't have time.<br>
Maybe it's expected students will pick things up along the way.<br>
Maybe they don't realize that those skills are important...<br>
<p align="right">(... because getting results is the primary focus.)</p>

. . .

<center><h3>This isn't just a university education problem.</h3></center>

## We are in a "reproducibility crisis"

:::

#

<center><h1>This has many causes</h1></center>

. . .

<br><center>"Publish or perish."</center>

<br><center>Incentives rewarding "fast" over "careful".</center>

<br><center>Science became much bigger much faster
before modern, user-friendly methods were developed.</center>

. . .

<br><center>**It's still very rare for scientists to publish their code!**</center>

# Why even do science?

<p align="right">After all, it should be about searching the truth.</p>

<br>

. . .

<center><h2>We should strive to do better.</h2></center>

<p align="right">_Especially_ as junior researchers, all of us.</p>

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>Sharing reproducible research code is crucial.</h3></center>

#

<center><h1>Counterpoint</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3>Is perfectly reproducible science automatically reliable and more 
trustworthy?</h3></center>


#

<center><h1>Automatically reliable?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>Definitely not.</u><br><br>

Research can be incorrect,
and still be perfectly reproducible in beautiful clean code.</h3></center>



#

<center><h1>More trustworthy?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>Most definitely.</u><br><br>
Having access to fully reproducible scripts and
pipelines is the only way to discover and fix errors, and build towards better research.
</h3></center>


#

<center><h2>The alternative to not publishing reproducible code and workflows
is the equivalent of not publishing proper laboratory protocols.</h2></center>

. . .

<br>

<center>**Materials and Methods**:<br> _"We ran a couple of PCRs on a few drops
from each extract."_</center>




## Reproducibility is has multiple levels

<center>**Often it's _you_ yourself who must reproduce your project!**
<br>(And it often happens under very stressful circumstances.)</center>

#

<center><h1>Every field of science today is computational</h1></center>

. . .

<br>
<center>Which is why trustworthy science requires building a solid basis in
computer programming and learning the best available techniques for
computational research.</center>

. . .

<center><h3><br>This workshop hopes to provide the opportunity to do exactly that.
</h3>(Focusing on reproducible R workflows as a general example.)</h3></center>

<h1>Wow this guy sure likes to talk a lot.</h1>

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

. . .

- I really like programming computers
  - I've been privileged to do it since I was a small kid
  - (Yes, I school I was one of those weird, unpopular nerds)

. . .

- I did BSc in Computer Science after high school

. . .

- I decided I don't want to work in an IT company

. . .

- I loved physiology/immunology topics in House MD TV series

. . .

- To the horror of my mom, I did _another_ BSc (Biochemistry)

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

- Then I did MSc in Cell Biology, but really sucked at lab work

. . .

- ... and I started missing programming again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

. . . 

- I applied for PhD at Max Planck Institute in Leipzig to study
aDNA of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and ancient humans

. . .

- Years of bioinformatics, data science, and statistics made me aware
of the barriers to reliable computational biology

. . .

- As an outsider (computer scientist) and an insider (a biologist), I have
a unique insight into both worlds

## Writing R has been my job for 10 years

<br>

1. _admixr_ ([bodkan.net/admixr](https://bodkan.net/admixr)) --- $f$-statistics
R package
2. _slendr_ ([bodkan.net/slendr](https://bodkan.net/slendr)) --- popgen simulations
R package
2. _demografr_ ([bodkan.net/demografr](https://bodkan.net/demografr)) --- R package
for simulation-based demographic inference (like ABC)

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>I design all my software (obsessively) to allow easy and
reproducible research for _everyone_.</h3></center>

<!-- # -->

<!-- <center> -->

<!-- <h1>Fun fact:</h1> -->

<!-- <h2>At the beginning I actually hated R!</h2> -->

<!-- </center> -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- <center> -->
<!-- I became a convert after seeing my experienced colleagues use it to do -->
<!-- amazing science (and create beautiful _ggplot2_ figures), and learning about -->
<!-- "modern data science movement" in R. -->
<!-- </center> -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- <center>**This workshop is a little bit like that:**<br> -->
<!-- _"The best of modern R for reproducible data science."_</center> -->

# 

<center><h1>The challenge of teaching a course on</h1></center>
<br>
<center><font size=20>_"The best of modern R for<br>reproducible data science"_</font></center>
<br>
<center><h2>is that our expectations and prior experiences are totally different.</h2></center>

<center>
<br>
<h2>So how did we deal with this?</h2>
</center>

<br>
<center>(_i.e., enough of philosophizing..._)</center>

## We made workshop, not lecture series

- Lectures would be guaranteed to be boring for some of you
  - (regardless of that arbitrarily set "expected competence")

. . .

- <u><b>Programming is a skill, not a knowledge to transfer!</u></b>

. . .

- We want to give as much time to "the practical" as possible:
  1. focus exclusively on "hands-on exercises"
  2. give you the chance to work on your own projects (hopefully integrating
  bits and pieces of the exercises)

. . .

- Give you safe space to do 1. and/or 2. <u>at your own pace</u>


## This workshop is also a (work)book

</center>

## If you already know (a lot of) coding

- Although many of the exercises might be easy for you, I suggest you
go through all of them anyway. I wrote all code from scratch and still
learned things I didn't know about.

. . .

- Every time you solve an exercise with a function you already knew,
spend some minutes on its help page. Skim through arguments you didn't
know, run its (obscure) examples.

. . .

- Each session has a _"Bonus exercises and resources"_ part with links
to _much more advanced_ topics that all expert R programmers
should know. Self-study in the remaining time.


## If you're just starting a coding journey

- Many exercises might feel overwhelming

. . .

- This isn't a lack of ability --- programming is about building
mental models of a problem and solving it in code

  - This is a skill like any other (languages, knitting, all crafts)
  - As such, it takes practice

. . .

- The exercises are designed to guide you through this process

. . .

- All materials are both exercises and real-world recipes for you to study later
and directly apply to your own work
  
# An crucial note, regardless of your level...

## 99% of exercises are given solutions!

As you go through the materials, you'll see this all the time:

<center>![](files/whoami/solution.png)</center>

. . .

This is the only way to make the workshop sustainable for all levels of
experience (I learned this the hard way).

<center><h2>But please, let's make a pact.</h2></center>

# Do not look at my solutions unless...

1. You're utterly lost
2. You asked me (or a colleague) for a hint and are still unsure
3. Or your done with your solution and want to check the result

Learning to solve computing problems is supposed to be hard and (sometimes)
frustrating. This is the only way to learn it.

# When you do look, don't blindly copy it into R...

1. Read each line of my solution
2. Think about what this line does
3. Re-type it into your R session (ideally by hand)
4. Run it like this line by line, inspecting intermediate results

Exercises are here to help you learn to build "mental models"
of programming problems. This is the only way to learn it.

<center><h1>We are _all_ here to learn</h1></center>

<center>
<br>
Share your ideas!
<br><br>
Discuss how the things you've learned apply (or not!) to
your own data and your own projects
<br><br>
Let's talk about options on how to use the content of the workshop to
improve your projects in the future.
</center>



## Our time schedule

<br>

- 10:00-12:00 Morning session
- 12:00-14:00 Lunch break
- 14:00-16/17:00 Afternoon session (depends on each day)

It's impossible to map each "topic" to specific time slot.

We'll play it by the ear.
