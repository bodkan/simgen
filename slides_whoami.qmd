# Data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility for population genetics in R

#

<center><h1>Why does this workshop even exist?</h1></center>

. . .

<br>

<center>Why am I stressing "programming", "automation", and
"fundamentals" so much in selling this workshop?</center>

#

<center><h1>Every field of science today is computational</h1></center>

. . .

<br>
<center><h2>Some less, some (much) more.<br>(such as genomics)</h2></center>

#

<center><h3>What scientists could avoid 10-15 years ago (in terms of
programming knowledge) years ago is no longer possible.</h3></center>

. . .

<br>
<center><h3>"In the old days" you could easily do cutting-edge biological
research with Excel.</h3></center>

. . .

<br>
<center> <h3>Education has been catching up, but not as quickly as it could
(and should).
</h3></center>

## The ECHO team said something very profound during early discussions


> _"When new students start their Master's/PhD degree, they're usually
thrown into a pond because their supervisor doesn't have time to
guide them through all the basic computational skills they should learn."_

. . .

Maybe they don't have time.
Maybe it's expected students will pick things up along the way.
Maybe they themselves don't realize those skills are important.

. . .

(Also, PIs are too often focused on the results at all costs.)

## We are in a "reproducibility crisis"

#

<center><h1>This has many reasons</h1></center>

. . .

<br><center>"Publish or perish."</center>

<br><center>Competitiveness rewarding "fast" over "careful".</center>

<br><center>People responsible for teaching not being familiar with modern
computing tools and techniques.</center>

# Why even do science?

<center>(It should be about finding the truth about the world.)</center>

#

<center><h1>Counterpoint</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h2>Is perfectly reproducible science automatically reliable and more trustworthy?</h1></center>


#

<center><h1>Automatically reliable?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>Definitely not</u>.<br>Research can still be wrong (even in subtle ways),
and we might just be reproducing it even with those errors.</h3></center>



#

<center><h1>More trustworthy?</h1></center>

<br>

<center><h3><u>I think so</u>.<br><br> Having access to fully reproducible scripts and
pipelines is the only way to discover and fix errors, and build towards better research.
</h3></center>

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

. . .

- I really like programming computers
  - I've been privileged to do it since I was a small kid
  - (Yes I was one of those "weird unpopular children")

. . .

- I did BSc. in Computer Science after high school

. . .

- I decided I don't want to work in an IT corporation.

. . .

- I loved physiology/immunology topics in House MD TV series

. . .

- To the horror of my mom, I did _another_ BSc. (Biochemistry)

## Who am I? --- a brief introduction

- I then did MSc in Cell Biology I realized I suck at lab work

. . .

- ... and I started missing programming again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<center>

<h2>At the beginning I actually hated R!</h2>

</center>

. . .

<br>

But after seeing my colleagues used it to do amazing science (and beautiful
_ggplot2_ figures), I invested time into learning it.

#

<center>

<h2>I've been an R programming scientist for 10 years</h2>

<h2>So how do we deal with this?</h2>
</center>


## Strategy #1: Workshop, not a lecture-based course

- Lectures would be guaranteed to be boring for some of you
  - (regardless of that arbitrarily set "expected competence")
