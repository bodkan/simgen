> Many problems in population genetics cannot be solved by a mathematician,
no matter how gifted. \[It\] is already clear that computer methods are very
powerful. This is good. It \[...\] permits people with limited mathematical
knowledge to work on important problems \[...\].

# Why use simulations?

1. Developing intuition into statistics
2. Estimating model parameters (i.e. [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation))
3. Ground truth for method development

## Simulation software

The most famous and widely used are [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) and [_msprime_](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/intro.html).

::: {.fragment}

They are <u>very</u> powerful and (nearly) infinitely flexible.

:::

::: {.fragment}

However, they both require:

- quite a bit of code for complex simulations (what is "complex" is relative, of course!),
- relatively high confidence in programming

<!-- (🐛🪲🐜). -->

<h3>Our exercises will focus on the [_slendr_](http://www.slendr.net) simulation toolkit for population genetics in R.</h3>

::: {.fragment}
<center><br>But, as a recap, let's look at _msprime_ and SLiM a little bit...</center>

<h2>What is _msprime_?</h2>

- A Python module for writing **coalescent simulations**

-   Extremely fast (genome-scale, population-scale data!)

-   You should know Python fairly well to build complex models

## Simple simulation using _msprime_

```{bash}
#| echo: false
cat script.py
```






## 

::: {.columns} 
::: {.column width="60%"}
<h2>What is SLiM?</h2>

- **A forward-time simulator**

- Has its own programming language

- Massive library of functions for:
  - demographic events
  - various mating systems
  - natural selection

-   More than 700 pages long [manual](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/releases/download/v4.3/SLiM_Manual.pdf)!

<h1>SLiM and _msprime_ are absolutely incredible pieces of software...</h1>

<h2>Why?</h2>

</center>










## First motivation: spatial simulations!

<center>![](images/animation.gif){width="70%"}</center>










## A broader motivation for _slendr_

- Most researchers are not expert programmers

- All but the most trivial simulations require lots of code

::: {.fragment}
- Yet, 90% <sup><font color="blue">\[citation needed\]</font></sup> of simulations are basically the same!

  - create populations (splits and $N_e$ changes)

  - specify admixture rates and admixture times

- ... all this means duplication of code across many projects
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Computing statistics presents even more hurdles
