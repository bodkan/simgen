# Time for the exercises!

## A couple of notes first

::: {.fragment}

Each exercise corresponds to a chapter of my [WIP "workbook"](https://bodkan.net/simgen/).

These slides are available at [this link](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/slendr-intro-handouts/)
as a single document, easy to use as a reference "cheat sheet".

Each exercise is split into individual Parts, intended to be solved one
after the other (each task **highlighted in bold**).

You will be coding complete simulations from scratch! If you ever get lost at some
task, just take a peek at my solution.

## Exercise 1

<br>

Building a demographic model with _slendr_, scheduling sampling events, and
simulating tree sequences.

<br>

Find the exercise [here](https://bodkan.net/simgen/slendr-models.html).

## Exercise 2

<br>

Computing population genetic statistics on tree sequences simulated with _slendr_.

<br>

Find the exercise [here](https://bodkan.net/simgen/popgen-stats.html).

## Exercise 3

<br>

Building a simulation-based inference pipeline of $N_e$ from an allele
frequency spectrum from scratch.

<br>

Find the exercise [here](https://bodkan.net/simgen/inference-afs.html).

## Exercise 4

<br>

Simulating a selection sweep by extending a base _slendr_ model with a
selection scenario implemented in SLiM.

<br>
