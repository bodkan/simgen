### Option 1: Your own data

I'm sure you have done some form of table munging and data visualization in your
projects. If you're done with the exercises above, here are some ideas for you:

1. If you haven't used R for processing of tabular data in your work -- maybe
you have done similar table munging in Excel or Google Sheets in a manual
(i.e., non-reproducible) way? -- write your processing steps as a self-contained
R script:

- If you used Excel, you can use the R package [_readxl_](https://readxl.tidyverse.org),
- If you used Google Sheets, you can use the R package [_googlesheets4_](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org)

2. If you used Excel or base R for plotting figures, use what you learned
about _ggplot2_ to make beautiful, publication-ready plots as we did in our
exercises.

Yes, this will put you in an uncharted territory. This is scary and totally
normal when doing research. I'm happy to help you out with questions
and issues!
