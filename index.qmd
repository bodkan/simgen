# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This workbook contains materials for **a work-in-progress course on the
fundamentals of data science, computational population genomics and statistical
inference in R, with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research**.

The general structure
of the final product (to be developed over the course of 2025-2026) will
be a set of interlinked worksheets with exercises, which students will be
able to walk through during an interactive course in the classroom, but which
will also serve as practical reference in their own projects later.

The git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course
are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/bodkan/simgen>.

**The intended audience are novice researchers who have just started (or are
about to start) their careers in population genomics and evolutionary genomics**,
primarily master students or doctoral students in the early parts of their
PhD journey. That said, the more advanced latter parts of the book focusing on
simulation-based inference of demography and selection will be beneficial even
to more seasoned researchers, who are looking for more efficient
means to fit models using novel inference tools in the R ecosystem.
