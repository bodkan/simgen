# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online workbook contains materials for **a work-in-progress course on the
fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference, with a strong
focus on good practices of reproducible research**. The general structure
of the final product (to be developed over the course of 2025-2026) will
involve a large set of inter-linked tutorials together
with worksheets containing practical exercises (and solutions).

The git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course
are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/bodkan/simgen>. Ultimately, the
workbook will provide
resources which will become the basis of a 1-2 weeks long course on population
genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations, with
a particular focus on R packages [_slendr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr)
and [_demografr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr). While introducing the
fundamentals of population genomics, it will also aim to frame the material
with a strong focus on the most important tools for facilitating reproducible
research (such as [_git_](https://git-scm.com) and
[_renv_](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)), as well as demonstrate the most useful
applications of a selection of R packages from the
[_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org) data science toolkit and other R packages
useful for computational genomics.

**The intended audience are novice researchers who have just started (or are
about to start) their careers in population genomics and evolutionary genomics**,
primarily senior master students or doctoral students in the early parts of their
PhD journey. That said, **the more advanced latter parts of the book focusing on
simulation-based inference of demography and selection will be beneficial even
to more seasoned researchers**, who are looking for more efficient
means to fit models using newly developed inference tools.
