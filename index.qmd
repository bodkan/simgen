# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online book contains materials for a work-in-progress course on the
fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference, with a strong
focus on good practices of reproducible research.

It is being developed as part of the collaboration between
University of Tartu and University of Copenhagen (Twinning project _ECHO_:
Expanding Concept and Methodology for Human Past Studies in the Eastern Baltic
Region).

The git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course
(which will be developed over the span of 2025-2026) are available on GitHub
at <https://github.com/bodkan/simgen>. Ultimately, the book will provide
resources which will become the basis of a 1-2 weeks long course on population
genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations, with
a particular focus on R packages [_slendr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr)
and [_demografr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr). While introducing the
fundamentals of population genomics, it will also aim to frame the material
with a strong focus on the most important tools for facilitating reproducible
research (such as _git_ and _renv_), as well as demonstrate the most useful
applications of a selection of R packages from the tidyverse data science
toolkit.
