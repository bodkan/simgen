# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This workbook contains materials for **a work-in-progress course on the
fundamentals of data science, computational population genomics and statistical
inference in R, with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research**.

The general structure
of the final product (to be developed over the course of 2025-2026) will
be a set of interlinked worksheets with exercises. Students will be
able to walk through those during practical sessions in the classroom or for
self-study, but the materials are also designed to serve as practical reference
during research work.

The git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course
are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/bodkan/simgen>.

**The intended audience are novice researchers who have just started (or are
about to start) their careers in population genomics and evolutionary genomics,
primarily master students or doctoral students in the early parts of their
PhD journey. However, the materials have also been used in successful training
workshops for researchers
who have an extensive experience with population genetics, but are not up-to-date
on the latest practices in modern reproducible data science, or some of the novel
inference tools in the R ecosystem.**
