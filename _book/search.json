    "text": "Preface\nThis online book contains materials for a work-in-progress course on the fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference, with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research.\nIt is being developed as part of the collaboration between University of Tartu and University of Copenhagen (Twinning project ECHO: Expanding Concept and Methodology for Human Past Studies in the Eastern Baltic Region).\nThe git repository containing the sources of all materials for the entire course (which will be developed over the span of 2025-2026) are available on GitHub at https://github.com/bodkan/simgen. Ultimately, the book will provide resources which will become the basis of a 1-2 weeks long course on population genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations, with a particular focus on R packages slendr and demografr. While introducing the fundamentals of population genomics, it will also aim to frame the material with a strong focus on the most important tools for facilitating reproducible research (such as git and renv), as well as demonstrate the most useful applications of a selection of R packages from the tidyverse data science toolkit.\n\nThe work-in-progress rendering of the book is available at https://bodkan.github.io/simgen.\n\nAll content is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.",
