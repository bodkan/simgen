# Slides

Here is a list of links to online version of slides we went through when
introducing each chapter before moving to the exercises. This is provided
mostly for completeness -- when working on the exercises, the single-page
versions of these slides (available under the 
Handouts](https://bodkan.net/simgen/handouts.html) heading will be probably
more useful.
