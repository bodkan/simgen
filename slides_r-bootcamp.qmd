# R bootcamp

## Useful shortcuts

- the challenge is that I have no idea what level you are at
- the problems and exercises are very very easy for me, but I write R for a living
- if they are trivial for you, still please try to go through them (maybe you
can give me comments on how I can improve them)
  - then pick a chapter in the incredible Advanced R text book, do
  a quiz at the beginning of that chapter
  - if you don't know all answers, study that chapter and do the exercises
  - this book is very advanced though, and really targetted at people who
  build software using R (a higher category of coding then data analysis)
