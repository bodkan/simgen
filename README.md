## Simulation-Based Population Genomics and Inference in R

**A course on the fundamentals of population genomics and statistical inference,
with a strong focus on good practices of reproducible research**

_(Developed as part of the **Twinning collaboration between University
of Tartu and University of Copenhagen**)_

---

This git repository contains the sources all materials for the entire course,
which is currently work-in-progress, and will be developed over the span of
2025-2026.

The aim of this work is to provide a free resource in the form of an
online-hosted web-book. This will become a basis of a 1-2 weeks long course
on population genomics and statistical inference using computer simulations,
with a particular focus on R packages
[_slendr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr) and [_demografr_](https://github.com/bodkan/demografr), as well as a selection of
the most useful tools from the tidyverse family of data science packages.

A WIP rendering of the web-book (currently containing a subset of practical
activities and their solutions) is available
[here](https://bodkan.quarto.pub/simgen-book/).
