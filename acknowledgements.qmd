# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Big parts of the first draft of this course have been developed primarily
as part of a collaboration between University of Tartu and University of
Copenhagen (Twinning project _ECHO_: Expanding Concept and Methodology for
Human Past Studies in the Eastern Baltic Region).

Huge thanks go to my students and mentees for showing me how focusing
on the essentials and fundamentals (rather than perfection and theory)
is the most important thing in pushing research project forward.
