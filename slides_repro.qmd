It's worth acknowledging that developing code as proper functions, using iteration,
and generally think about solving problems using "proper" program approaches
like that is a lot of work. It might seem that "just copying a bit of code
a couple of times" is easier. In the moment, it actually is.

Except we rarely, if ever, do things only once. We have to come back to old
scripts, update them, or add new steps. Doing this for every single bit of
copy pasted code (sometimes in multiple scripts) is awful, and almost always
results in bugs. Even missing one edit in one copy of a piece of code will
make our results wrong.

**It's always worth investing a bit extra time into extracting repeated
pieces of code into individual functions. It will always result in _less work_
in the long run.**
